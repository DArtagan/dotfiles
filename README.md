Deprecated dotfiles:
* chunkwm: project is no longer developed.  Move to `yabai` instead.
* fish: configuration moved to `home.nix`, now ceasing to maintain the `fish` directory.
* termite: terminal deprecated.  Author recommends using `alacritty` instead.
* zsh: ceasing to maintain the configuration files.  `fish` has all the shell niceness, batteries included.
