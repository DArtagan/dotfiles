2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:18:55] i posted in forum
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:19:39] javier_: could you please provide the link to it?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:19:58] look at this, https://www.dropbox.com/s/mq6wwuiabayvc37/instant%C3%A1nea5.png

2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:20:53] if i downgrade to version 30, no problem
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:21:35] javier_: please start firefox fom konsole, and check for any error messages
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:21:49] at least I cannot reproduce your issue
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:22:29] javier_: also, you did not answer ahjolinna's question about the gtk2 theme
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:22:32] which one do you use?

2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:23:30] and all with problem
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:23:39] javier_: why are you executing firefox as root?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:23:48] that's wrong on any level
2014-07-27 12:32:18	brli_ms	[10:23:55] javier_: please don't sudo firefox that way...
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:24:01] tell me please
2014-07-27 12:32:18	brli_ms	[10:24:11] javier_: just firefox
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:24:18] ok

2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:24:49] and everuthing the same
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:25:07] javier_: please pastebin the complete output
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:25:18] and I really doubt that you got Error: cannot open display: :0
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:25:23] (process:17308): GLib-CRITICAL **: g_slice_set_config: assertion 'sys_page_size == 0' failed
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:25:27] or are you running it on a tty
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:25:35] if so, don't do it
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:25:39] but run it in konsole
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:26:11] now i'm using oxygen-gtk
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[10:29:04] javier_: no more output?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:29:12] no
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:29:21] this is the only line
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:30:35] i don't understand about running ona tty
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[10:31:51] Inkane: yesterday he tried to run firefox wih "firefox -safe-mode" and "firefox -P test" (new profile) and got the same
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[10:32:48] So can't be because extensions nor themes. Maybe something related to cache?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:34:39] javier_: did you run "firefox" from konsole?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:34:51] or from a tty (accessed from ctrl+alt+f1)
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:35:09] no, for konsole
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:35:35] and did the output contain Error: cannot open display: :0 ?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[10:36:39] Inkane: maye because sudo instead kdesu?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:36:52] dmnmsc: yes, but he stated that the output was the same
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:36:55] when run without sudo
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:37:01] which would be confusing
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[10:37:55] I bet he was meaning the  GLib-CRITICAL ** part
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:38:56] javier_: you might want to try the official version from mozilla
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:39:01] and check if that one works
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:39:13] if not, there's not much we can do for now
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:39:54] [javier@chakra-pc ~]$ firefox

2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:40:35] i run it in konsole
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:41:50] look at another screeshot: https://www.dropbox.com/s/q91571ovdibkxbe/instant%C3%A1nea6.png
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:42:44] javier_: did you try  the official version from mozilla already?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:42:52] nop
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:43:15] i don't know how to do
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:43:29] javier_: just donwload the one from mozilla and run it?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:43:40] ok
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:45:55] I only do that
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:47:47] i downloaded, but how can i run it?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:48:40] javier_: extract the files
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:48:43] and look for firefox-bin
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:49:15] yes
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:49:40] then just execute firefox-bin
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:49:47] you probably just need to double click it
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:49:50] yes and the same problem
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:50:06] so it shows exactly the same symptoms?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:50:14] yes
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:50:19] then I'm not sure if we can do much about it
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:51:08] javier_: you might want to try firefox 32 beta
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:51:11] https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/channel/

2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:51:13] but firefox 31 in Kaos work fine in another partition
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:51:37] javier_: well, do you have exactly the same settings on chakra and on kaos?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:51:56] because this seems clearly related to your settings
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:52:00] as no one else reported the issue
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[10:52:06] and it also happens with upstream firefox
2014-07-27 12:32:18	brli_ms	[10:53:03] javier_: tried to open in new profile?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:56:13] done
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:56:55] what now?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	brli_ms	[10:57:54] javier_: open firefox in new profile
2014-07-27 12:32:18	brli_ms	[10:58:05] and see if something go wrong
2014-07-27 12:32:18	javier_	[10:58:09] ok
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:20:19] hmmm shouldn't the new user be created with Chakra's default look? I tried creating a new one and looks like a common KDE but not Chakra's KDE (with caledonia and other stuff)
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:20:56] dmnmsc: when did you install Chakra?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:21:05] Inkane: a long time ago...
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:21:14] the files were not in skel
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:21:18] can't remember to be honest
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:21:26] you want chakra-live-skel for that
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:21:42] though it might conflict with a few unowned files
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:21:46] depending on when you installed chakra
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:22:02] I only implemented this for the last (?) ISO afair
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:22:36] oh, I can't install it because chakra-live-skel: /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme exists in filesystem
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:22:51] that's what I meant
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:22:58] let me backup the file...
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:22:58] on the old ISOs
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:23:09] some files were simply not owned by any package
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:23:11] will affect my main user?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:23:56] it shouldn't
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:25:46] let me test :)
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:30:52] Yes. Thank you Inkane
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:30:57] yw
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:32:13] what's the state of kf5 btw?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:32:22] I men in Chakra
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:32:25] mean
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:32:26] dmnmsc: frameworks works just fine
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:32:41] still in kde-next repo though
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:32:51] for plasma 5, ask AlmAcka
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:33:06] there's an issue with finding the window decoration
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:33:09] in kwin
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:33:14] because some path is messed up
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:33:20] (we're not sure which one)
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:33:32] ah ok. thanks!
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:33:37] besides that, we could get a starting session
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:33:41] not coinstallable though
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:34:06] and are you planning to release a kf5 testing  ISO?
2014-07-27 12:32:18	Inkane	[11:34:32] I'm not, but I think AlmAck is
2014-07-27 12:32:18	dmnmsc	[11:35:40] haha ok. I will ping AlmAck later
2014-07-27 12:32:18	_d3f	[12:05:13] I need some help with CCR. I did makepkg --source in an AUR package and tried to upload the *.src.tar.gz

2014-07-27 16:10:58	ahjolinna	FranzMari: the problem is that, the underlying gcc bug actually exists back to 4.5, it just happened to only trigger on this code in 4.9.
2014-07-27 16:11:05	FranzMari	well...Linus is Linus
2014-07-27 16:11:48	FranzMari	I know nothing about
2014-07-27 16:12:11	FranzMari	but I suppose the price's not given for GCC being "bug-free"

2014-07-27 16:15:59	FranzMari	he isn't always right ;)
2014-07-27 16:16:13	ahjolinna	FranzMari: Linus hates whens some borken s***t get pushed to upstream

2014-07-27 16:18:54	FranzMari	Inkane: that's so true

2014-07-27 16:20:56	ahjolinna	FranzMari: well its the Finnish way, and it works..."be outspoken"
2014-07-27 16:21:15	Inkane	javier_: it's quite hard to find the correct config setting in that case

2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[21:47:36] and then just write    export __GL_YIELD="USLEEP"
2014-07-28 09:07:09	LanDi	[22:23:15] ahjolinna: what it can change ?
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[22:24:06] LanDi: everything becomes smooth and snappy
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[22:24:41] and no tearing
2014-07-28 09:07:09	LanDi	[22:25:07] ohh
2014-07-28 09:07:09	LanDi	[22:25:08] ok
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[22:31:26] LanDi: will you try it?
2014-07-28 09:07:09	LanDi	[22:31:42] I have saved the file
2014-07-28 09:07:09	LanDi	[22:31:49] with export __GL_YIELD="USLEEP"
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[22:31:59] now reboot
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[22:32:14] thats it
2014-07-28 09:07:09	LanDi	[22:32:50] ok :)
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[22:42:08] LanDi: did it work?
2014-07-28 09:07:09	LanDi	[22:42:49] I can't restart now due to a dvd recording
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[22:42:59] ok
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[22:48:48] LanDi: before this I had tearing even on videos....now I don't :P
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[22:49:19] LanDi: and everything works little bit better(animation)
2014-07-28 09:07:09	LanDi	[22:49:53] cool

2014-07-28 09:07:09	LanDi	[22:52:52] my virtual box does not work anymore
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[22:53:33] LanDi: at least we will test how well it will work for others
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[22:53:49] LanDi: aaa
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[22:55:18] LanDi: u have to reinstall virtualbox
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[22:58:13] LanDi: you have to recompile virtualbox kernel modules
2014-07-28 09:07:09	LanDi	[22:58:24] ok
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[23:00:57] LanDi: I cant remember the command that makes it to recompile
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[23:01:29] thats why reinstall is the option
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[23:03:38] LanDi: okay I found it
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[23:03:40] it was
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[23:03:45] sudo  /usr/bin/vboxsetup setup
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[23:04:20] LanDi: you have to do that on every kernel upgrade
2014-07-28 09:07:09	LanDi	[23:05:05] ok
2014-07-28 09:07:09	LanDi	[23:05:07] cool

2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:14:30] Silly dropbox service menu.. "Couldn't get public url: Illegal Argument: The path "/Public/palemoon.txt" does not exist"
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:14:41] URL should be ~/Dropbox/Public/
2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[08:15:05] dmnmsc: drop that one from official repo :P
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:15:21] brli_ms: it's the ccr version!
2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[08:15:28] I recall there is an equal one in ccr?
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:16:35] mmm I think I have it installed through kde services...
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:16:44] the official repo version wants kfilebox
2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[08:18:24] dmnmsc: you can ignore that via -Sdd
2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[08:18:37] or, should I reubild it to strip kfilebox?
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:20:15] sure it's more elegant but... dropbox-service menu without kfilebox as dependency makes no sense
2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[08:21:08] true, even though it is REALLY a fake dependency :P
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:21:24] haha
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:21:34] let me check something
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:23:12] nah.. still the same
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:37:15] OK. Now I have two dropboxservices. One which is not working because the previous error and one which is forcing me to set user and password to access the public folder.....
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[08:37:16] dmnmsc: what dropbox version do you use?
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:37:30] ahjolinna: ccr version. Dropbox, not experimental
2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[08:38:18] dmnmsc: hmm, weird, I use ccr one for long, and service menu never fail me
2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[08:38:36] (I also don't use recommended directory)
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:38:38] ahjolinna: problem is using "move to public folder and paste to klipper.     "Couldn't get public url: Illegal Argument: The path "/Public/hwinfo" does not exist"
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[08:38:53] dmnmsc: ccr version should work, experimental has that same service menu problem
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[08:40:09] dmnmsc: try if generate public URL works in your dropbox Public folder
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:40:20] ahjolinna: yes, that's working
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[08:40:41] dmnmsc: same with experimental
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:40:42] problem is "/Public/" I guess hosuld be ~/Dropbox/Public/
2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[08:40:48] dmnmsc: then...stick to the two-step way :P
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:40:49] should*
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:40:57] brli_ms: haha
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:41:20] Need to figure how to set that...
2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[08:41:30] dmnmsc: should be $DROPBOXDIR/Public
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:41:46] hmm
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[08:41:58] dmnmsc: did you try the experimental version?
2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[08:42:09] it should read the info somewhere provides in ~/.dropbox-master (? the actual name slipped off my mind)
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:42:25] ahjolinna: no becase I knew there was a problem with servicemenu and I use it a lot
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[08:43:03] dmnmsc: I use also the service menu alot
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:43:37] brli_ms: not in /usr/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/Drobox........

2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[08:51:45] I thought they rename it some where?
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:51:53] brli_ms: that's on /usr/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/
2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[08:52:22] dmnmsc: i mean host.db
2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[08:52:32] is it in THAT certain dir?

2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[08:55:28] That's part of Dropbox-Tools_servicemenu.desktop with moves files OK but forces to password. I should look to the other dropbox servicemenu which is moving to /Public instead to dropboxdir/Public
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[08:55:34] brli_ms: where is it now?

2014-07-28 09:07:09	brli_ms	[09:03:13] why not use plain text...
2014-07-28 09:07:09	ahjolinna	[09:03:56] maybe dropbox has some api change
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[09:05:00] I have no /.dropbox/config.db
2014-07-28 09:07:09	dmnmsc	[09:05:25] nor /.dropbox/dropbox.db

2014-07-28 09:09:16	ahjolinna	it's only avoiding it
2014-07-28 09:09:47	dmnmsc	I will set dropbox_path="$HOME/Dropbox"

2014-07-28 09:13:48	dmnmsc	So there is something wrong in "get_dropbox_folder.sh".  But can be avoided locally just changing dropbox_path=`${SCRIPTS_PATH}get_dropbox_folder.sh`to dropbox_path="$HOME/Dropbox"
2014-07-28 09:13:53	dmnmsc	ahjolinna: no, just that line

2014-07-28 09:18:14	dmnmsc	I'm not smart enough to debug the get_dropbox_folder.sh, but there is something wrong there
2014-07-28 09:18:36	dmnmsc	which is not setting the correct path
2014-07-28 09:18:55	ahjolinna	but it has happend now with the latest updates
2014-07-28 09:19:08	ahjolinna	it can be a dropbox thing

2014-07-28 09:29:35	dmnmsc	now I wonder why the latest dropbox servicemenu  (from kde-services) forces you tu use user and password on your Public folder
2014-07-28 09:30:49	dmnmsc	I want to share someting with you but you will need to enter user and password to see it. OK... useful if you want it, but not f you are forced to enter user and password
2014-07-28 09:39:49	ahjolinna	really
2014-07-28 09:39:56	ahjolinna	hmm?
2014-07-28 09:42:21	dmnmsc	Yes. it's useful if you want to protect the file with password, but is not always needed... some files should be visible just opening... without users nor passwords

2014-07-28 17:54:46	ahjolinna	....but you need to in the end
2014-07-28 17:57:20	tiemay	mmm, I might need to switch to a different os till I get a new computer :p

2014-07-28 18:01:43	ahjolinna	tiemay: when will you buy a new computer?
2014-07-28 18:01:53	ahjolinna	laptop or desktop?
2014-07-28 18:08:31	tiemay	the new one? I havn't decided. I don't really bring my computer places, but I really like being able to move it around the room. However after a few years, this laptop started constantly breaking, and if laptops are typically like that, I never want another one.
2014-07-28 18:08:33	tiemay	I don't want to spend a ton of money, and I've heard laptops are more expensive for the same thing cuz smaller parts. I could use something with decent horsepower now that I do some packaging and 3D graphics programs.
2014-07-28 18:08:54	tiemay	so ya, I havn't decided

2014-07-28 18:19:05	tiemay	if I get a desktop, I'll need a screen, keyboard, mouse, and either way I've been thinking about getting a drawing tablet
2014-07-28 18:20:34	ahjolinna-jolla	tiemay: Sony VAIO laptops are currently cheap now because Sony sold their PC business
2014-07-28 18:21:12	ahjolinna-jolla	and sony VAIO are the best
2014-07-28 18:22:30	ahjolinna-jolla	Now VAIO is coming back with just VAIO brand, for now only in japan
2014-07-28 18:24:33	ahjolinna-jolla	tiemay: I would buy a VAIO or lenovo ThinkPad  or asus zenbook
2014-07-28 18:25:02	tiemay	VAIO only for Japan? I don't live in Japan though
2014-07-28 18:25:36	ahjolinna-jolla	tiemay: but the old sony are still available

2014-07-28 18:26:18	ahjolinna-jolla	both
2014-07-28 18:27:04	ahjolinna-jolla	you can still buy sony VAIO laptops this year
2014-07-28 18:28:16	ahjolinna-jolla	tiemay: go to some pc store and they should have some
2014-07-28 18:28:35	ahjolinna-jolla	tiemay: or any store that sells laptops

2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:27:22]  I have lost all fate for this movie,  It has almost nothing to do with the books
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:29:44] or Book
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:30:19] the movie makes me so confused
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:33:45] they are good movies, but they are so betrayal for Hobbit/LOTR book fans
2014-07-29 15:44:03	totte	[11:44:36] The scenes with that female elf are so awkward.
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:46:26] totte: her fighting scenes were cool
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:47:24] totte: but that elf female and dwarf romance went too far
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:47:37] it was so stupid
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:47:51] and not in the book
2014-07-29 15:44:03	totte	[11:49:04] The part where she's "healing" him and there's this.... light around her and she's chanting... I wanted to disappear into the ground. It was just too much.
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:49:39] totte: and if we won't see Gandalf and Saruman together fighting.....I want my money back at least !!!
2014-07-29 15:44:03	totte	[11:49:53] It was years ago that I read the book but I don't recall Legolas being mentioned in it.
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:51:43] totte: It was ok to see him in at the beginning but why did he have to follow them?
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:53:33] totte: it would be natural to see Legolas in that place, because he was there..but he was not part of the story
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:53:37] but now he is
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:53:51] -_-
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:55:41] totte: I want to see  Gandalf and Saruman kick some ass....btw. that gandalf thing never happend in the book..he never became a prisoner
2014-07-29 15:44:03	totte	[11:55:58] Well. It all seems like a fastpaced action movie to me. What I liked about the book was the exploration and adventure, the trek. This... constant arcade game-style of fighting (especially the barrel ride) is just... dull.
2014-07-29 15:44:03	totte	[11:57:05] The part where the fat dwarf pops out with two axes while in a barrel and cutting up the orcs was ridiculous.
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:57:12] if we dont see Gandalf and Saruman, its a complete betrayal
2014-07-29 15:44:03	totte	[11:57:38] Is Saruman-actor still alive?
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:57:39] totte: that was just awesome
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:57:42] OV
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:57:44] OC
2014-07-29 15:44:03	totte	[11:58:34] Christopher Lee... I must have confused him with someone else.
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:58:36] there is no reason why they cant do it
2014-07-29 15:44:03	totte	[11:59:04] ahjolinna: "Sorry, can't do that. It's not what the target audience wants."
2014-07-29 15:44:03	totte	[11:59:05] :D
2014-07-29 15:44:03	totte	[11:59:49] "Instead we decided to shoot more dwarf-elf romance scenes!"
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[11:59:55] it's the most awesome part of the book
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[12:00:49] totte: dwarf-elf romance scenes is because of all feminist
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[12:00:56] im 100% sure of that

2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[13:02:12] javier_: new profile= resets everything so did you have any theme on firefox ? (like Oxygen KDE (Firefox Theme))
2014-07-29 15:44:03	ahjolinna	[13:02:31] ...on the old profile

2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:32:52] FranzMari: But I have dcron.service unloaded. Is needed for cron?
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:33:11] ahjolinna: what is the patch doing?
2014-07-30 16:25:45	ahjolinna	[15:33:22] Inkane: no idea
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:33:34] ahjolinna: can you pastebin it?
2014-07-30 16:25:45	ahjolinna	[15:33:52] the patch??
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:34:04] also, it uses phonon_compat as the include dir
2014-07-30 16:25:45	ahjolinna	[15:34:47] Inkane: http://paste.kde.org/potn2au4w

2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:35:47] ahjolinna: do  you have phonon-qt5 installed?
2014-07-30 16:25:45	ahjolinna	[15:35:51] yes
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:36:25] dmnmsc: I suppose it is
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:36:44] unless you're not using dcron but cronie or other implementations
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:37:30] ahjolinna: not sure why it is failing
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:38:05] except that the phonon_compat seems wrong
2014-07-30 16:25:45	ahjolinna	[15:38:16] Inkane: its an cross-platform Qt5 comicbook reader, i have no idea why it uses phonon
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:38:36] ahjolinna:probably  for multimedia
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:38:44] ahjolinna: try to add /usr/include/phonon4qt5/phonon to the includepath
2014-07-30 16:25:45	ahjolinna	[15:38:57] where?
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:39:13] FranzMari: seems cronie is not installed, but I have crond which seems a system-settings module for cron
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:39:34] ahjolinna: there should be a .pro file in the source folder
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:39:40] add
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:39:50] INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include/phonon4qt5/phonon
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:39:53] to it
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:40:57] dmnmsc: look in the system settings
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:41:34] FranzMari: Yes, theres is a module with no crons running there and no info about dcron daemon needed or not :)
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:42:11] nor selecting "system cron" instead of "user cron"?
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:43:02] FranzMari: nor selecting system cron
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:43:13] actually, goes grey when switching to system cron
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:43:23] here too
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:43:41] it's because you don't have permissions to chage system cron
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:43:44] I suppose
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:43:53] yes, tried with kdesu systemsettings
2014-07-30 16:25:45	ahjolinna	[15:43:54] Inkane: I did add it, compile failed...and I checked the file again and it/the edit was gone
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:43:56] and I'm seeing it
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:44:14] ahjolinna: you have to add it programattically in the PKGBUILD
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:44:18] before calling qmake
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:45:57] FranzMari: But I have two scripts in /etc/cron.daily/ (not setted by me, of course). One of them says updatedb with "exec ${IONICE} ${NICE} updatedb -f proc" order. And I used to run sudo updatedb myself
2014-07-30 16:25:45	Inkane	[15:46:29] ahjolinna: using echo should suffice for that
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:47:52] dmnmsc: uhm...it would mean that cron'snot active
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:48:26] so, run # systemctl enable dcron.service
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:48:57] then (or before, it's the same) # systemctl start dcron.service
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:49:09] and install privoxy-blocklist
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:49:15] FranzMari: seems so. Probably I will remove the daily updatedb and enable dcron.service. Also I have logrotate and man-db scripts in /etc/cron.daily..... and no idea what they do
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:49:31] me neither XD
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:49:36] FranzMari: do you have those scripts as well?
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:50:28] let me check
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:50:42]   /etc/cron.weekly/
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:50:47] no, daily...
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:50:53] yes, I have
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:51:08] hmmm ok
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:51:24] but i have no dcron.service
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:51:24] Thank you FranzMari!!
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:51:34] np
2014-07-30 16:25:45	FranzMari	[15:51:35] ;)
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:51:35] ah, just like me
2014-07-30 16:25:45	ahjolinna	[15:51:36] Inkane: I give up
2014-07-30 16:25:45	dmnmsc	[15:51:58] ahjolinna: Inkaene left/lose connection
2014-07-30 16:25:45	ahjolinna	[15:52:02] damn
2014-07-30 16:25:45	⚡	dmnmsc [15:52:42] "Inkaene"... OK, dmnmsc, OK......

2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:10:28] DarrinS: hello
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:24:49] @ahjolinna i'm stumped as to how to get this intel atom's display working again after the "big update". any news or have i been quietly left on my own?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:25:45] DarrinS: again intel gpu problem -_-'
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:25:49] damn
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:26:23] should i be shopping around?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:27:16] DarrinS: we are waiting for the next driver update from intel, but let check that you have everything done right
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:27:45] thanks
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:28:13] DarrinS: so what hardware do u have?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:28:48] Intel Corporation Atom Processor D4xx/D5xx/N4xx/N5xx Integrated Graphics Controller
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:29:27] 1024x600 max resolution
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:30:47] does this mean anything to you?: http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos/2013-March/133289.html

2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:33:03] well the problem is with the latest drivers, they are little bit unstable on old hardware -_-'
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:33:54] i like my old hardware. reminds me of me
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:34:49] i would love to roll back to a pre-big-release state
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:35:20] DarrinS: hi, what's your fs?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:35:28] fs = filesystem
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:36:02] DarrinS: anyways, you should consider using btrfs
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:36:37] msx: really? on old hardware?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:36:47] DarrinS: so you can create a snapshot of your subvolume before upgrading anything so ini the event anything goes wrong you just restore that snapshot
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:37:03] ahjolinna: absolutely, why not?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:37:07] ext4. i would love a more modern fs, but i'm new to linux and i find the written instructions confusing and often faulty
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:37:45] ahjolinna: i agree that it could be a bit cpu intensive but that's depending on how you mount your subvolumens
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:37:46] msx: btrfs is better for SSD
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:38:14] ahjolinna: i.e. i often see some spikes here on top but that's because i mount my fs with the autodefrag flag
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:38:28] btrfs is better for everything :D
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:38:30] btrfs <3
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:38:41] DarrinS, msx: apparently there is now the new xf86-video-intel
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:39:12] msx: I also love btrfs, even SailfishOS uses on the Jolla Phone btrfs
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:39:31] sudo pacman -S xf86-video-intel ?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:39:41] DarrinS: i can't remember right now if Tribe supports Btrfs but using it shouldn't be any different than using ext4
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:39:43] DarrinS we dont have it
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:40:04] d'or!
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:40:13] d'oh*
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:40:31] DarrinS: have to ask AlmAcK if or when he will update it
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:40:59] i haven't seen him to speak to him
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:41:11] DarrinS: the version is now 2.99.914...maybe we will wait for 3.xxx
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:41:54] SOB*
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:41:55] ahjolinna: getting back on track with the important stuff, how different is Finlandia from Absolut? (and a plain *better* wont do it as the answer!!!)
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:42:59] i prefer single malt scotch
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:43:38] msx: Finlandia is from finland thats why its better..and Absolut is from sweden so its sucks
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:43:44] :D
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:43:53] hahaa

2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:46:29] DarrinS: there are still few issues with the driver... I will ask AlmAcK what his plans are
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:46:57] DarrinS: do u have any other gpu than intel?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:48:10] thanks. no. this netbook barely holds its own guts. the gpu and cpu are on the same chip i believe
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:48:26] yes they are
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:48:56] DarrinS: you really should buy a new one
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:49:04] DarrinS: isn't kde heavy for your little buddy?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:49:22] msx: not really
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:49:28] it cooks along nicely, thanks
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:49:35] cool
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:49:40] kde <3
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:49:56] i was 100% satisfied before the update
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:49:58] msx: kde-next <3
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:50:13] ahjolinna: uuuh! are you running it!?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:50:21] faster than win7 crippled
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:50:41] DarrinS: its intel's fault
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:50:43] DarrinS: well, it's wincrap
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:51:16] msx: nope but it tried it
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:51:17] build linux dedicated hardware and the world is a better place

2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:52:19] DarrinS: my policy regarding that is to buy my next laptop with an already-installed distro, any -- so i can ensure whatever leenux i throw on it will work
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:52:53] that works in theory, but then ...
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:53:23] ahjolinna: looks so smooth :D
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:53:24] dell sells ubuntu certified, but the prices!!
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:53:35] DarrinS: exactly
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:54:07] DarrinS: problem with vendors selling linux laptops is that they overprice them as if you had to pay for a licence, nonsense!
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:54:10] msx: knuckle-bump
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:54:29] here in finland there are few laptops/desktops that have linux pre-installed...and you can buy prebuild desktop and choose linux for 20€(i think it was 20)
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:54:35] that's why i keep this netbook
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:55:03] and they are cheaper than windows version
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:55:35] DarrinS: so knucle-bump is when you hit your fist with your mate as if it were a high-5? lol, i just learned how that was dubbed, tnx xD
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:55:47] i paid $160 for it 3 or 4 years ago. what's the price or a chromebook today?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:56:19] DarrinS: what about system76? or any other less-known vendor?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:56:21] ~200
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:56:56] there is also https://zareason.com/

2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:57:05] chromebooks? pfff, they are way expensive depending on the model you choose
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:57:18] my limiting factor is poverty
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:57:32] DarrinS++
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:57:38] same here xD
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:57:48] same
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:57:57] more knuckle bumps all around
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:58:00] now days
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:58:19] DarrinS: my limiting 2 factors are: 1. poverty, 2. living in a shitty country that filters all the imports
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[19:58:48] like the good ol u s of a?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:59:36] I hate my old Desktop: CPU: Intel i5-2550K, Ram: Corsair Dominator: 24GB DDR3 1866Mhz GPU: 2x Nvidia 560GTX, ssd: Ocz 120gb, HDD: 11tb, Full ATX case:  NZXT Phantom 820
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:59:37] DarrinS: anyways, if you ever reinstall chakra don't forget to check if you can use btrfs as your filesystem, then process as usual. I personally recommend placing /home on an independent partition
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[19:59:43] DarrinS: ha, i wish :P
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[19:59:55] msx: btrfs does not yet work
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:00:27] next ISO it will
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:00:35] don't make me call arch
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:00:42] ahjolinna: it isn't available in Tribe? ohh, what a downturn :/
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:00:52] ahjolinna: ahhh cool! :D
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:00:59] arch <3
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:01:22] albeit i'm running bubuntu right now -- and i must say this: i'm enjoying it :D
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:01:22] i never got arch to make a smooth desktop
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:01:59] arch is cool but it takes way to long time to setup, and updates can break your system way more likely
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:02:42] DarrinS: I did, in fact i ran arch for several years, but in order to achieve an smooth experience you have to do *plenty* of work on it -- almost like if you were running gentoo. That's what i love from Chakra, the guys put a lot of love and takes care of (almost) everything
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:02:53] DarrinS: btw. what problems did u have with the update?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:03:29] so betweem running Arch+KDE as i've been doing and Chakra i go with the latter all the way
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:03:35] *between
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:05:00] aside from grub issues, the display scrambles at one point during bootup, then reverts to 800x600. Also, networkManager vomits a bunch of output onto a once-quiet boot process.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:06:34] DarrinS: wait for the driver update
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:06:47] will do
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:08:15] DarrinS: if that wont help, reinstall....new ISO will be available when kde 4.14 is available...so 20 August
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:08:28] i don't believe the NM output is negative, simply status output. i appear to have missing files/folders in my /boot/grub... structure
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:09:30] i can live with what i have for a while, so i can wait for a new iso
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:09:34] it seems that only users that have problems are old hardware owners
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:10:53] maybe chakra should start to have somekind of system requirements, lol :P
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:11:08] BOOOO.....
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:11:52] if torvalds were dead he'd spin in his grave
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:11:58] that's the neverending problem with leenux
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:12:18] one release works beautifully well, next one screws everything up
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:12:36] windows is different??
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:12:41] yes
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:12:44] yes
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:12:44] nothing works
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:12:52] LOL
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:12:53] nope, not that way
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:13:02] it works as it suppose to
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:13:15] badly
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:13:16] that i think is fine for an end-end-end-end-user
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:13:30] hey!
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:13:36] that's we all feel it a canned OS
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:13:36] be kind
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:13:51] LOL
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:14:14] win8 was so perfect
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:14:16] DarrinS: you aren't one of those, other way you would never be using leenux
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:15:06] DarrinS: even better, end-end...-users don't even know what irc is about, and it's been kicking since some good 15 years now
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:15:15] i've been using computers since 1976, and chakra is the first linux system that hasn't struck me as a mere curiosity
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:15:33] cool
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:15:41] DarrinS: what 8-bits did you have!?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:16:03] damn you guys are old
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:16:11] i still have a vectrex
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:16:21] look it up
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:16:22] ahjolinna: relax, you're on the way ;)

2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:28:24] same
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:28:26] imagine what a hacker could do to the cellular system in this country with hardware level access to the tx/rx functions
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:28:56] we have enough domestic terrorism
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:29:22] DarrinS: old-witches unfounded chit-chat, believe me ;)
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:29:58] we're back-water
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:30:48] USA is nowadays so paranoid, more than usually...that is saying a lot already
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:31:18] DarrinS: well, that's a sensible topic but terrorism in 1st world countries and economic apocalypse, violence and corruption in 3rd-world countries like mine are some of the ways governments and people who rule behind the courtains have to control masses like cattle
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:31:23] don't lose sight of a child for a second
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:32:05] my decision: don't buy BS, be critic and analyze everything media throws to my face

2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:33:07] ahjolinna: but don't forget that's a way to create anxiety among their citizens
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:33:16] ahjolinna: so they can then sell whatever they want
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:33:28] ahjolinna: just like the mass-destruction weapons of Saddam
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:33:59] ahjolinna: that never were there, never existed. But when you remember Bush and his politicians talking about that on the news, oh man...
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:34:07] ahjolinna: it was like the end of the world :P
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:34:09] television hasn't been allowed in my house for a decade now. now we just amass weapons.

2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:36:47] ahjolinna: sad but true
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:36:58] ahjolinna: corporations and bankers owns america
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:37:20] the oil industry owns america
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:37:33] fact.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:37:40] absolutely

2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:38:38] and train people in all fecets of science toward the petrol industry
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:38:54] DarrinS: exactly

2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:39:50] DarrinS: that's why an awesome country as USA is didn't invest heavy on solar, wind and other renowable technologies yet
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:40:01] or i did until i crushed the left side of my body
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:40:11] DarrinS: at least you earn some good money, i hope
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:40:28] holy crap, i hope you're good man
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:40:30] the non democratically elected people are the ones who are really in the control of the country
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:40:32] legislation halds it back.... there are lobbyists
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:41:01] lobby should be illegal.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:41:01] i'm walking and talking, so life goes on
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:41:15] DarrinS++

2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:44:45] DarrinS: I find it embarrassing that over half american people believe in personal god, and thinks than USA was founded with religion....in god we trust came to dollar in -60's (i think)
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:45:16] end of -60's
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:46:13] it was always on the money after the founding of the federal reserve
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:47:29] and the founding documents were written by religious men based on christian ideals
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:47:39]  has appeared on paper currency since 1957.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:49:01] my grandmother has some silver certificates from the early 20th century, but i haven't seen them in years. maybe so regarding "In God We Trust"
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:49:56] but the declaration and constitution were penned by religious men with christian ideals
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:49:57] they were however all secualrists (meaning they believed that church and state should be seperate, to each his own.)
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:50:18] yes. live and let live.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:51:23] but those religious ideals are respected as long as they do no break the laws based on christian value. sharia law is unconstitutional.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:51:58] thou shalt no kill, and all
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:54:31] DarrinS: islam, christianity and Judaism are all part of the same "family"
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:55:55] it's stoning and oppressing women and children that sticks in our gullets
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:56:44] islam claims a long history in the USA dating back to its roots... this is a lie
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:57:07] DarrinS: btw. that is what christianity did in the dark ages, now christianity  has almost now power left..Islam has so thats why we still see that stuff
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:57:09] those words were issued from obama's lips
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:58:05] the killing has to stop, that's all i know with any certainty
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:58:40] DarrinS: biggest reason is religion
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:58:50] DarrinS: ahjolinna: did you guys watch the new Robocop? (btw, classic Robocop movies <3
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:59:02] DarrinS: ahjolinna: do you agree world is heading that way?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[20:59:20] DarrinS: here in finland only 5% really belive in god, and 10 little bit, and rest are atheist
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:59:21] I mean, a robotic, militarized brave new world
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:59:40] Finland <3
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[20:59:40] i prefer the original robocop. the sfx is cool, but...
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[20:59:58] DarrinS: yes, but i talk about the world is heading
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[21:00:13] we already have drones, why not mech suits next?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[21:00:59] human beings well of creativity will never run dry when it comes to warfare
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[21:01:08] in Japan nobody see their self as religious, and japan has the lowest crime rate in the world...and they also have death penalty for the worst people
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[21:01:18] DarrinS: bc I don't think USA are just paranoid bc nothing, i really think govt. officers are indeed paranoid bc the reality they face - whatever it is and they can't speak about it - is waaaaay worst
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[21:01:59] after all usa is still the ruling power, the first economic power and surely the first military power
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[21:02:08] they're trying to pretend that a 2nd civil war might be in the future
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[21:02:29] might not be*
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[21:02:31] DarrinS: hmm you're absolutely right
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[21:02:51] i already saw that, there are even some new games about that possible scenario
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[21:03:06] ahh.. why life has to be so complicated :P
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[21:03:11] =)
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[21:03:29] or own declaration of independence makes such a move lawful in the current administration
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[21:03:56] best part is that USA sucks at wars
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[21:04:23] Vietnam?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[21:04:25] our infantry is thin
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[21:04:34] so?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[21:04:46] ahjolinna: hmm, they were kicked in the ass in vietnam but i wouldn't declare that
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[21:04:58] can't win wars without occupation
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[21:04:59] ahjolinna: after all how many wars they've been fighting so far?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[21:05:05] DarrinS: exactly
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[21:05:23] yes you can
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[21:05:32] ahjolinna: how?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	DarrinS	[21:05:36] it's not politically correct to occupy anymore
2014-08-04 13:36:47	msx	[21:05:46] totally true!
2014-08-04 13:36:47	ahjolinna	[21:05:53] lol

2014-08-04 13:36:47	edge226	[04:52:04] I guess nobody in here knows, I guess I'll talk with boom when I see him :)

2014-08-04 13:36:47	totte	[05:56:29] edge226: Development of what, specifically?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	totte	[06:00:09] Web development: Vim (with plugins like fugitive, jedi, ctrlp, syntastic), git (combined with rsync for deployment), iPython, ctags, ...
2014-08-04 13:36:47	edge226	[06:35:05] totte: do you guys use the arch devtools?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	edge226	[06:35:11] or a modified version?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	edge226	[06:36:41] totte: if so I have been making a wrapper for those tools that you guys may be interested in, far from complete but still greatly increases the speed at which one can compile initial repositories. its in -early- development at this stage but its progressing quickly.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	edge226	[06:37:58] totte: atm it allows for easy and quick compiling of package sets. So if certain maintainers had to compile a bunch of packages at one time that could easily be automated.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	george2	[06:56:46] edge226: hey, you may get more visibility if you post to our dev mailing list, since everyone here is in different timezones :)
2014-08-04 13:36:47	edge226	[06:58:58] george2: I dont do mailing lists.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	george2	[06:59:52] ha, ok. Well feel free to stick around then, it just might be a while before people are here.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	totte	[07:00:48] edge226: You could mention that to AlmAck or Inkane, both are GMT+1 I believe and online in the evenings.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	edge226	[07:01:08] george2: I've talked to boom in the past, we know each other so I know if I talk to him the information needed will be passed appropriately ;)
2014-08-04 13:36:47	george2	[07:01:09] yeah, brli too might be interested, he does a lot of packaging
2014-08-04 13:36:47	totte	[07:01:17] Easiest way would be to post to the chakra-devel mailing list.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	edge226	[07:01:25] totte: see above.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	edge226	[07:01:43] I dont like spam, a mailing list would just be inviting spam.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	totte	[07:02:00] I read it, still, it's the easiest way to get in touch with the "right" people.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	edge226	[07:03:07] nah, the easiest way is to talk to the 'right' person and have him pass the information along. Otherwise I dont really care. I do not even use chakra was just going to extend a tool I am building onto another distribution that as far as I know builds thier packages in a similar manner than I am for my distribution.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	totte	[07:05:42] Sure, I'm not going to argue. If you want to contact them via IRC you'll need to be here when they are though, which was my point.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	edge226	[07:07:31] totte: There is a lot that still needs to be done on these tools. I only started them less than a week ago. I work fast though :)
2014-08-04 13:36:47	edge226	[07:08:02] totte: so if they see them ASAP or after they have matured a bit more and have more functionality it does not matter to me.
2014-08-04 13:36:47	totte	[09:28:12] edge226: Do you have a public repository? What language is it written in?
2014-08-04 13:36:47	totte	[11:47:16] Holy smokes... I just found out that I can convert future dates from CEST to UTC and vice versa with `date` - this is about the most helpful discovery I've made this summer!
2014-08-04 13:36:47	totte	[11:49:14] Not counting `jrnl` which replaces me keeping a log in my shell history by doing `echo "Today we went on a hike."`...

2014-08-10 21:04:40	csslayer	[16:42:53] dmnmsc: yeah,I already installed aur one
2014-08-10 21:04:40	csslayer	[16:43:15] seems it works for me
2014-08-10 21:04:40	dmnmsc	[16:43:28] hmm then something with globalmenu? :s
2014-08-10 21:04:40	csslayer	[16:44:34] dmnmsc: I tried the app menu.. no change
2014-08-10 21:04:40	csslayer	[16:46:01] actually opera-developer is the second browser works with my hi dpi screen...
2014-08-10 21:04:40	dmnmsc	[16:46:23] I really love what they are doing... 24v is my main browser nowadays
2014-08-10 21:04:40	dmnmsc	[16:49:21] csslayer: can you try the ccr version? :)
2014-08-10 21:04:40	csslayer	[16:51:30] dmnmsc: might related to your video card?.. Just a random guess
2014-08-10 21:04:40	dmnmsc	[16:52:01] csslayer: no idea, but 24v is working fine. I updated to ccr. I'm waiting the rage comments xD

2014-08-10 21:04:40	csslayer	[16:55:30] dmnmsc: ccr one also works for me ..
2014-08-10 21:04:40	dmnmsc	[16:56:08] hmmm maybe one of my extensions? Slly opera not allowing incognito mode or new profile by cli....
2014-08-10 21:04:40	csslayer	[16:57:18] dmnmsc: move your configuration file to somewhere else?..

2014-08-10 21:04:40	dmnmsc	[16:59:58] extensions or config for sure
2014-08-10 21:04:40	dmnmsc	[17:02:12] the funny part is: isn't opera the one who is growing up... it's X
2014-08-10 21:04:40	dmnmsc	[17:14:17] lol... were the bookmarks :\
2014-08-10 21:04:40	dmnmsc	[17:29:07] Also, globalmenu works very well.. but not using locale language.

2014-08-10 21:04:40	KyriosBrastianos	[19:55:55] msx: do u have problems or know any issues with docker + btrfs? I know virtualbox isn't blending well with btrfs so i was keeping home as ext4 and only media as btrfs.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:10:52] KyriosBrastianos: hey! well so far so good, no problems here. In fact docker is meant to work alongside btrfs
2014-08-10 21:04:40	KyriosBrastianos	[20:11:19] msx: Great
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:11:23] KyriosBrastianos: because it has a built-in functionality to make use of btrfs snapshooting capabilities
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:11:54] KyriosBrastianos: i'm running docker + btrfs + kernel 3.14 on ubuntu 14.04, works really good
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:12:22] KyriosBrastianos: and to be honest i can't come back to anything else than btrfs, it is really an amazing FS
2014-08-10 21:04:40	KyriosBrastianos	[20:12:29] what about your discs?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	KyriosBrastianos	[20:13:07] I had slower system when i tried to go btrfs in my home/root
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:13:21] KyriosBrastianos: normal stuff: on my laptop i have an skorpio black (western digital), 7200rpm, on my NAS/home server i have a maxtor 5400rpm
2014-08-10 21:04:40	KyriosBrastianos	[20:13:32] but i was on a hdd now i got ssd
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:13:51] KyriosBrastianos: make sure your kernel is > 3.13
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:14:01] that makes a whole of difference
2014-08-10 21:04:40	KyriosBrastianos	[20:14:13] i am 3.15 on chakra :P
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:14:41] KyriosBrastianos: but yes, btrfs seems indeed to be somewhat slower on some operations, most notably heavy mysql use
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:14:55] KyriosBrastianos:
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:15:19] i think that in phoronix there's a good comparative about btrfs, ext4 and xfs
2014-08-10 21:04:40	KyriosBrastianos	[20:15:46] can't go kubuntu atm uninstalled 2 months ago and tried manjaro and kaosx as alternatives to chakra
2014-08-10 21:04:40	KyriosBrastianos	[20:16:13] msx: what is your opinion for xfs?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:16:41] KyriosBrastianos: the on-the-fly features like autodefragment are LZMA compression are amazing!!!
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:16:51] KyriosBrastianos: btrfs ^  ^
2014-08-10 21:04:40	KyriosBrastianos	[20:16:53] i see it as default system for kaos
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:17:09] indeed anke and Dezponia seems to love it
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:17:32] same with daniel robbins (gentoo/funtoo founder), but i never used it, can't tell
2014-08-10 21:04:40	KyriosBrastianos	[20:18:19] was looking at my options for root/home and xfs pops out a lot
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:18:23] KyriosBrastianos: still if i weren't to use btrfs i'd go with xfs
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:19:03] try them all for yourself and pick your own poison ;)  for me btrfs does it, no need to look for anything else
2014-08-10 21:04:40	KyriosBrastianos	[20:19:23] I am just feel more attached and excited about btrfs and all its development current features and future
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:19:30] but again some people likes vim [trolling]and we men prefer Emacs[/trolling]
2014-08-10 21:04:40	KyriosBrastianos	[20:19:41] the other FS that gets me excited is illumos
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:19:47] same with irssi / weechat, awesomeWM / spectrWM, etc.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:20:00] GNU Screen / tmux, Leenux / BSD, pick your choice
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:20:28] KyriosBrastianos: illumos has its own FS? i wasn't aware of that :P
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:21:10] KyriosBrastianos: btrfs aim is a really sharp one: be better than zfs -- and only that!
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:21:35] OTOH xfs is being developed by redhat for handling big data
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:21:49] i mean *big files*
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:22:04] there is where xfs really shines
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[20:23:01] *that's were :P

2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[11:49:55] spaceninja: the old/current ISO is broken'ish, u should wait that we have update/released the next ISO. That would be after kde 4.14 has been released (20.8.14)
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[11:51:45] most of our dev's are on vacation, so we thought it was smart to wait and release the next ISO with kde 4.14
2014-08-10 21:04:40	spaceninja	[11:52:02] ahjolinna: Ok, I really need a distro with updated packages +kde, Just need kdenlive and krita
2014-08-10 21:04:40	spaceninja	[11:53:05] ok I guess I have to wait.  It's good that there's actually a distro who is interested in getting the latest desktop up and running as soon as possible.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	spaceninja	[11:53:13] like kde
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[11:53:31] sorry, this is the situation now
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[11:53:53] we are also working on kde-next
2014-08-10 21:04:40	spaceninja	[11:54:02] np, thanks for the clarification
2014-08-10 21:04:40	spaceninja	[11:54:05] what's kde-next?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	spaceninja	[11:54:14] some repos?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[11:54:19] kde5
2014-08-10 21:04:40	spaceninja	[11:54:27] wow sounds massive :)
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[11:54:30] kf5 + plasma5
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[11:56:06] spaceninja: we have the first live cd available (with kf5 and plasma5 and some apps)

2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[11:57:30] kf5.1 ISO will have probably have calamares (qt5 installer) also
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[11:58:22] spaceninja: this is calamares : http://kaosx.us/media/cala_web.webm
2014-08-10 21:04:40	spaceninja	[12:01:48] looks cool
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[12:11:53] spaceninja: hopefully we can use "kde 5" when plasma 5.1 and kf5.3 has been released (October 20)
2014-08-10 21:04:40	spaceninja	[12:48:06] ahjolinna: being patience is key, thanks for the clarification, cya
2014-08-10 21:04:40	totte	[04:28:43] Shutting down the website temporarily, just a quick fix. Two-three minutes.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	totte	[04:46:41] How come `find /tmp/foo -type d -exec chmod -c 0755 {} \;` doesn't unset the setgid bit but `find /tmp/foo -type d -exec chmod -c g-s {} \;` does?

2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:35:49] DarrinS: msx is from argentina
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:35:57] oops
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:36:18] well almost
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:36:37] ..correct
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:36:38] i see AlmAck. i hope he is coding or doing whatever wizardry he does
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:36:57] he is making kf5.1 iso
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:37:40] i downloaded an iso off of his announcement but alas it does not boot
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:37:47] DarrinS: he is taking vacation from his vacation
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:37:59] kind of him
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:38:25] i can be patient
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:38:37] DarrinS: the chakra-kf5-2014.07.30-dev-x86_64.iso ?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:38:53] let me see...
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:40:15] that would be a yes
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:40:30] DarrinS: did you try to boot with non-free drivers?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:40:57] and do u have amd gpu?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:41:16] it says NO OPERATING SYSTEM FOUND
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:41:33] i have an intel atom
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:42:23] well it  worked for me
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:42:59] maybe you have a corrupt ISO
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:44:00] i'll re-download the image.  what do you suggest for writing is to the MicroSD card?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:44:23] or kf5 wont work with your pc
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:45:12] DarrinS: suse studio imagewriter
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:45:27] that would be unfortunate
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:45:44] no dd command?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:46:01] no
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:46:45] DarrinS: i mean that maybe kf5 wont not work now
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:47:26] i'll redo the iso process and see what breaks
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:47:52] the next iso will have calamares installer
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:49:34] you fellas will have me selling a car so i can afford hardware to run it ;)
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:52:52] DarrinS: well I have to buy a laptop just for chakra testing, I dont want to break my over 2k € desktop
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:53:51] and I want a new desktop for next gen gaming :D but thats next years problem
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:54:35] maybe you should buy a ... ugh .... macintosh
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:54:50] I dont hate myself
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[15:58:19] when you turn on your dream pc do local powerplants go nuts trying to control brown-outs?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[15:59:23] no?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[16:00:06] DarrinS: btw. the next regular ISO will come to after kde 4.14 has been released
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[16:01:02] DarrinS: and why would they?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[16:01:04] i'll settle for the 1st iso to bring my screen back to usable dimensions
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[16:02:20] some people want gpu and cpu setups that need liquid nitrogen to cool them. i wantes to see how nuts you take your gaming.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[16:03:11] I have liquid cooled cpu
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[16:03:47] not the whole thing submerged in mineral oil?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[16:05:26] i have corsair Hydro H80
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[16:06:09] with two Noctua 120 x 120 x 25mm NF-F12 industrialPPC-3000 PWM
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[16:06:16] fans
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[16:06:32] i'm upset that nobody continued the ww2 submarine simulator genre
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[16:06:43] lol
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[16:07:09] those two noctua fans costs 25€ each
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[16:07:25] new games are too fast-paced and stressful for an old man.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[16:07:56] DarrinS: you should play RTS games
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[16:08:11] which?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[16:09:12] oh. strategy games.... meh...
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[16:09:14] my favorite are Dawn of war, but you would like company of heroes ...it uses same engine and made by same studio
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[16:10:04] you don't know what kind of a nut i am for ww2 submarines
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[16:10:23] DarrinS: those RTS games arent normal strategy games..they are way better
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[16:11:10] i'll check them out on youtube

2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[16:20:31] at least on max
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[16:21:24] too much game for my aging creepers

2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[17:11:11] ahjolinna: do you know anyone who owns a Ouya game system?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:11:23] yes, its horrible

2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[17:13:29] why does tech hate me?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:14:02] tech hates old people
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[17:14:17] 8D
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[17:15:21] cell phones are the worst offenders
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:16:28] no, just android, IOS and WP...oh righ that blackberry os
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:16:42] only SailfishOS is good
2014-08-10 21:04:40	msx	[17:20:37] ahjolinna: finnish crap. Go Tizen go!
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:21:13] msx: oh shut up you traitor

2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[17:28:59] to be clear on this ISO I'm booting... Is it supposed to print output like PXE-M0F: Exiting PXE ROM then sit here for an hour stupidly blinking a cursor?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	george2	[17:30:13] probably not :)
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[17:30:27] nice.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	george2	[17:30:55] Is this the 08 kf5 iso?
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:31:05] yes
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:31:07] I think you must wait for the intel driver update
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:31:24] DarrinS: ^
2014-08-10 21:04:40	george2	[17:31:24] yeah, AlmAck just said it doesn't boot :)
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS	[17:31:27] end of the month
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:32:06] george2: 5.1 does not boot, but 5.0 does
2014-08-10 21:04:40	george2	[17:32:22] oh yeah, I already installed the 5.0 iso
2014-08-10 21:04:40	george2	[17:32:23] works great
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:32:32] nice
2014-08-10 21:04:40	george2	[17:32:45] Not much software on it, but... :)
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:32:53] george2: I will wait for 5.3 and plasma 5.1
2014-08-10 21:04:40	george2	[17:33:10] Wait a minute, I never did install it did I, it had no tribe. I guess I ujst live booted it on the netbook.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:34:28] george2: kf5.1 iso is the only iso that has an installer (calamares), okay we dont know if it works
2014-08-10 21:04:40	george2	[17:35:02] yeah. I assume if it doesn't boot it won't install either :)
2014-08-10 21:04:40	george2	[17:35:20] I just downloaded the xdelta when almack said it was broken.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:36:05] I just downloaded the complete ISO
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:36:33] 100m connection:P
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[17:37:21] i wanna be a Finn...
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:37:31] DarrinS_: you have to wait for an ISO that has an new/updated intel driver
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:37:52] 100M is only 19€/month
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[17:38:20] DarrinS will wait his turn and envy your broadband
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:38:47] btw. I pay 34€/month for unlimited talktime txt and 4G data on my phone :P
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[17:39:05] eat a fish
2014-08-10 21:04:40	george2	[17:39:18] yeah, no way you can get a plan that cheap here :D
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:39:57] and that 4G is 150M
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[17:40:31] my  life sux (._.)
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:40:34] that is now the speed what they give
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:40:57] and my connection never breaks
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:41:13] almost
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:41:31] few hiccups
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[17:41:39] yeah, but finnland will be under an ocean within the century
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[17:42:21] of course, so will Florida
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:43:06] nope, only metropolitan area(helsinki/espoo)
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:43:39] and that  would be in 100 years, over
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[17:44:39] how long will you live? medical advancements on the horizon, etc.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[17:45:15] gene therapy and growing organs from your own dna...
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[17:45:34] you could live to be 140
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:45:35] well average finnish man is over 80y
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:45:41] now days

2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[17:55:30] finland doesn't need an uneducated, unemployed, crippled middle-aged men i assume
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[17:55:51] :D no
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[17:56:47] florida flourishes on my type... pharmacueticals, medical bills...
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[17:57:28] crushing debt, no economy... love it here!
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[18:02:13] finland has now 60% debt of its GDP, we had almost none before 2008 !!!
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[18:03:42] blame it on fossil fuels, nukes, and overpopulation
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[18:04:08] no, thats not it...its EU/euro

2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[18:06:10] DarrinS_: here is the reason: http://libera.fi/libera-uusi/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Euro_EN_140513a.pdf
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[18:07:12] made by the Helsinki Univerity professors
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[18:07:44] Helsinki University is in top 80
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna	[18:07:59] and its free
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[18:09:09] i've spent a lifetime killing brain cells so free university is good for my kids, but useless to me.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna-jolla	[18:10:31] DarrinS_: what :)
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[18:11:06] your gaps are medical.  mine are medicinal.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[18:11:55] as in... i promise to NEVER MEDICATE MYSELF LIKE THAT E V E R AGAIN.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[18:12:13] (O.O)
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna-jolla	[18:14:43] DarrinS_: I know that your country doesn't have the medical care but still there should be some good doctors
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna-jolla	[18:15:11] damn auto correct
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[18:15:56] i've already been pieced together as well as can be. nerve damage fixes itself or doesn't.
2014-08-10 21:04:40	ahjolinna-jolla	[18:18:16] there are stemcell treatments
2014-08-10 21:04:40	DarrinS_	[18:19:01] too soon to tell... it's only been since january

2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[12:57:01] Warranty means nothing, only that they will replace it
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[12:57:06] wtf do with you hardware?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[12:57:14] Nothing dangerous

2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[12:57:52] Hell my SGSIII was in an otterbox with a zagg invisible shield

2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:03:31] Also incredibly overrpriced
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:03:37] -_-
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:03:38] The performance gain isn't really worth it
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:03:44] -_-
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:04:06] oh yes it is
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:04:21] Dude I put an SSD in a laptop on the dell site replacing the HDD of the same capacity and the priced doubled for the entire laptop
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:04:31] And that was like 2 months ago
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:05:04] if u putt ssd on crappy pc that wont much help
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:05:18] The hardware was pretty good
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:05:23] but I cant stand using HDD pc
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:05:26] Decent processor, the GPU was intell though
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:05:26] they are so slow
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:05:34] Runs fine for me
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:06:18] You must have a lot of money to afford to complain because your computer with an HDD was too slow
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:06:54] Desktop: CPU: Intel i5-2550K, Ram: Corsair Dominator: 24GB DDR3 1866Mhz GPU: 2x Nvidia 560GTX, ssd: Ocz 120gb, HDD: 11tb, Full ATX case:  NZXT Phantom 820
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:07:21] You need 24GB of RAM?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:07:37] At that point a whole 8 gigs is entirely worthless
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:07:44] Anything about 16 is basically a waste man
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:09:22] No wonder you complain about having an HDD you're spoiled man
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:09:28] my firefox alone uses 6gb
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:09:57] Dude mine uses like half a gig
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:10:07] Also the more ram you have the more is used
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:10:17] The system reserves ram for processes that might need it
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:11:22] I also have Roccat Ryos Pro mk with brown switches + roccat kone pure mouse = 200€ +80€
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:11:30] Dude you are spoiled rotten
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:12:03] I spend all my money on tech
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:12:51] I also got free phones from nokia
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:13:13] I had a phone when i was 6y nokia 3210
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:13:23] ..... I think I've figured out my WINE problem......
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:13:34] I didn't have lib32-intel-dri installed
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:14:12] there is something like that?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:14:14] oh
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:14:19] -.-
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:14:39] what...never used intel gpu
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:17:32] That was not it it seems
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:18:06] have you recompiled playonlinux after the big update?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:19:06] What big update?

2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:22:44] DiscipleOfDante: btw. how can i be spoiled if I get some nice tech if I do well at school?  I was one of the best in my school (all of them)
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:22:49] ...don't answer that, it was rhetorical
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:22:57] Still spoiled
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:23:11] If an HDD makes your computer so slow you can't use it, you are spoiled ROTTEN
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:23:24] Also no big update available and my mirrors are synced.....
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:23:50] i meant the big update that happend

2014-08-14 10:58:44	+AIDE	[13:27:07] Title: Playonlinux cant find 32-bit OpenGL Libraries (Page 1) / Stable / Chakra | Forum (at chakraos.org)
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:28:41] Yes but I can't install lib32-libglapi
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:28:56] why not?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:28:57] It conflicts with lib32-mesa
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:29:06] And mesa
2014-08-14 10:58:44	DiscipleOfDante	[13:29:25] Which is more than a little fudged up

2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[13:39:04] ahjolinna: hahaha. I had some conflicts.. but nothing important. I was able to remove the files and install again if needed
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:40:35] dmnmsc_: good for you
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[13:45:26] yeah
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:47:49] DiscipleOfDante: so wait you hate(/think they are bad) those game because they arent your type of games?!
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[13:52:47] dmnmsc_: why did you have 18 months old system ?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:00:02] ahjolinna: this is an old HDD. I moved my SSD to other laptop
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:06:19] dmnmsc_: why?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:06:59] because this laptop has no screen and needs to be plugged to an external monitor. So I moved my ssd to my working laptop, which has screen xD
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:07:33] what? :D
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:07:54] what you read. The screen is broken and I won't repair it
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:12:10] sure you didn't expect that XD
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:12:54] dmnmsc_: is the other laptop better?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:13:41] ahjolinna: HAHAHAHAHAHA is a powerful Intel Celeron SU 2300 xD
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:13:50] sigh

2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:14:09] "dear god"
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:14:13] but... the Celeron has more RAM xD
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:14:53] voi jesuksen kristuksen perkele -_-'
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:16:31] dmnmsc_: how do u live with yourself?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:18:03] Easy: I'm happy. I don't need the best tech to be happy
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:19:28] dmnmsc_: well the the lvl of our happiness is written in our DNA
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:24:04] dmnmsc_: btw. please up the dosage on whatever you are taking...U need help

2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:28:12] dmnmsc_: who can be happy with crappy hardware?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:28:38] ahjolinna: this crappy hardware is useful for my uni stuff. All that I need.
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:28:49] I have my main laptop and my uni laptop
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:29:28] no no no...does not compute
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:29:41] and... my main laptop has 7 years old xD
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:30:06] maybe 8

2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:30:49] sigh
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:31:10] hahaha
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:32:22] dmnmsc_: yeah my previous statement was correct, you need help
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:32:48] if you are happy with that

2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:33:30] Im not even happy with mine
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:33:45] As I said, just sent me your old hardware when you change it
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:33:53] :D
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:33:58] both we'll be happy
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:35:35] I think I would get better laptops for free here in finland....
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:36:05] and desktops
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:37:06] ahjolinna: then catch one and send it to me
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:37:33] yeah right...im way to lazy for that
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:37:56] ahjolinna: always wanted a Thinkpad
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:38:04] so... cathc one and send it to me
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:42:29] dmnmsc_: almost 2y ago I throw away 2 laptops that was 3-4y old....I got them for free...they didn't work...I cant remember what was broken..it was something minor
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:43:12] well  didn't like it if didin't work xD
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:44:21] dmnmsc_: it was something to easy to fix
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:44:25] ahjolinna: what was needed for dropbox-experimental?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:44:30] remove what?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:46:57] ~/.dropbox ..........not needed to do...but if there is some problems
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:47:21] nah, seems is working fine
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[14:58:05] dmnmsc_: btw. DiscipleOfDante  said that SSD are horrible and dies once year and the performance gain isn't really worth it
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:58:54] I have 3 ssd, no one of them died yet. And performance is so much better than HDD
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[14:59:16] my Celeron with SSD is faster than my i5 with HDD,,,
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:00:05] actually  he also said that every tech devices are horrible and they  dies / breaks in 1 year
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[15:01:05] well, a lot of them does
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[15:01:14] do* (?)
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:01:46] crappy ones
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:01:48] oc
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:01:58] cheap ones
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:03:18] and then I told him that Intel has made SSD with 5-10 y warranty......then he said: "Doesn't mean they last for 5-10 years, just means you get a replacement"
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:05:00] " Warranty means nothing, only that they will replace it"
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[15:05:45] well, you have different point of view
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:05:58] thats a really good thing for a profit seeking company
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:07:45] does he really think that intel puts 10 years warranty just for fun and does not expect it to last that long
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:09:48] if every device would break before the warranty, no company could make profit
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:10:18] dmnmsc_: yeah he is wrong im right
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[15:10:24] ahjolinna: nah.. .people like you throw away their devices even when are on warranty xD
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[15:10:54] that's why companies make profit xD
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:11:24] we are minority
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[15:11:40] haha
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:15:17] I can't understand why people are so surprised that, Samsung and other cheaply manufactured product are horrible and will break easily
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[15:15:35] so.. what brand should we use?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:16:00] depends on product
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[15:17:08] laptop and mobile devide
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[15:18:03] device
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[15:20:06] car= any german or japanese goes...TV= Sony, Laptop= VAIO or Asus...Mobile= Jolla (OC) or Sony, Monitor= Dell

2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[17:27:03] dmnmsc_: wouldnt  LXQt (qt5) be better for you?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[17:29:50] ahjolinna: with ssd is working fine
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[17:29:58] I guess would be a pain with hdd
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[17:30:22] but probably LXQt would be a beter option. But I'm a Chakra guy...
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[17:30:55] you could install it on chakra?
2014-08-14 10:58:44	dmnmsc_	[17:31:29] one guy tried a long time ago (wasn't eyome?) but wasn't able
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[17:32:05] it was when LXQT was really early in development
2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[17:32:22] now they have qt5 port

2014-08-14 10:58:44	ahjolinna	[09:13:56] fine i will rebuild it for myself
2014-08-14 10:58:44	brli_ms	[09:15:19] ahjolinna: hope it will fix

2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[03:41:39] totte_: hey, what about discourse: http://www.discourse.org/
2014-08-14 10:58:44	+AIDE	[03:41:41] Title: Discourse (at www.discourse.org)
2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[03:42:25] check out the blog: http://blog.discourse.org/2014/06/discourse-v1-0-next-month/
2014-08-14 10:58:44	+AIDE	[03:42:26] Title: Discourse V1.0 Next Month Discourse Blog (at blog.discourse.org)
2014-08-14 10:58:44	totte_	[03:42:36] fairc: I've been following that for a long time... It looks promising, especially if it can combine mailing lists and discussion fora into one.
2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[03:42:59] the blog comments are seamlessly integrated with the forum
2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[03:43:36] would love to see this at chakra
2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[03:45:02] also they povide an api, so it would be possible to read the forums in a dedicated software (like a newsreader)
2014-08-14 10:58:44	totte_	[04:18:20] The one catch it being written in Ruby, which I know next to nothing about.
2014-08-14 10:58:44	totte_	[04:20:28] There is very little discussion taking place in chakraos.org/forum though, making a more Q&A-oriented software (like StackExchange) quite appealing.
2014-08-14 10:58:44	totte_	[04:30:25] I'd rather have had Discourse starting out from mailing lists than discussion fora. I get the feeling that the e-mail support bits are more of "addons" than the actual underlying foundation of it. As far as I know you can't create new topics/threads/discussions by sending an e-mail or send attachments.
2014-08-14 10:58:44	totte_	[04:34:17] "Discourse is really email for notifications (of new topics, in digest emails, and when people reply to you) and replies (you can reply to those email notifications via email) but is not yet suited for 100% email-only interaction. It's a hybrid of email and web at the moment."

2014-08-14 10:58:44	+AIDE	[04:34:34] Title: How to "sell" Discourse as mailing list replacement? - Discourse Meta (at meta.discourse.org)
2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[04:52:13] to be honest the current forum software is quite a PITA, so I would state this as one of the reasons for the little activity
2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[04:52:38] (the other one would be the no so large user base (yet))
2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[04:52:54] I don't get the hang of mailing lists
2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[04:53:27] all ML I read I have subs as newsgrouped via gmane.org
2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[04:54:26] and as I said before: If you prefer the not-browser interface, the way to go is using the API
2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[04:54:54] then you could read the forum in knode for example
2014-08-14 10:58:44	totte_	[04:59:25] Most developers and packagers tend to prefer mailing lists, most users tend to prefer fora. I'm a bit stuck mostly using e-mail myself since it's preferable to using a forum in the web browser on a mobile device among other reasons.
2014-08-14 10:58:44	totte_	[05:00:27] FluxBB is currently quite... eh... still, since the developers focus on the upcoming 2.0 branch which uses Laravel which I'd rather not have to install if possible.
2014-08-14 10:58:44	totte_	[05:02:33] My idea was to use DjangoBB (if I remember the name correctly) unless Discourse or AskBot is wanted by the others. DjangoBB does the classical discussion board thing as it has been done for the last two decades and shouldn't be too difficult to integrate with the rest of the website in terms of authorization and authentication (single sign-on, etc.).
2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[05:03:44] "Most developers and packagers tend to prefer mailing lists": yes, but this is no conrtadiction. IMHO the forums are more for user-user support
2014-08-14 10:58:44	totte_	[05:05:03] Well if the Holy Grail of communication over the Interwebz appeared, being the very best from mailing list and bulletin boards - I'd very much like to give that a spin. Having a single system is preferable to two.
2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[05:05:43] so that means discourse, right? :-)
2014-08-14 10:58:44	totte_	[05:06:30] It would be nice if users, packagers and developers would hang out in the same place as opposed to being separate. At least in a small group like this where there only are like... 16-20 contributors.
2014-08-14 10:58:44	totte_	[05:06:57] Discourse is certainly the most promising, right now.
2014-08-14 10:58:44	totte_	[05:08:12] I'm a bit opposed to having too much talk happen in #chakra-devel for instance, I'd rather it be used only when #chakra is too lively.
2014-08-14 10:58:44	fairc	[05:08:54] agreed, but its (currently) difficult if you prefer a native discussion interface over a browser - but then againg discourse is also the most promising here.

2014-08-14 10:58:44	totte_	[05:10:01] george2: Do you have any idea regarding how archweb and alpm.py could read repositories across HTTP?

2014-08-14 10:58:44	george2	[10:48:47] totte: Mezzanine I've never heard of, but I've seen a lot of CMSs for Django... a simple blog/news app with an rss feed is literally a couple hours work though, I'm not sure it would be worth it to use someone else's solution.
2014-08-14 10:58:44	george2	[10:50:49] totte: and no idea about alpm, but it wouldn't be hard to just scrape an http packages list, if that's what they're doing... or just download the database for each repo and parse it like pacman does.
2014-08-14 10:58:44	msx	[10:56:36] george2: mezzanine <3

2014-08-14 11:01:30	george2	Does it have forums and wikis and stuff, or do you just mean for the static pages?
2014-08-14 11:01:56	msx	george2: for everything else than the forums (me thinks)
2014-08-14 11:02:14	msx	george2: i could ask the guys later what they say
2014-08-14 11:02:46	george2	ok, cool. Might as well, if it could save us that much work.
2014-08-14 11:03:49	george2	It would need to be able to integrate with the rest of our django apps though, hope that's not a problem.
2014-08-14 11:04:41	msx	well, if you already have some django apps running then mezzanine could be an option. There are some other frameworks too like Pyramid IIRC
2014-08-14 11:04:44	msx	*Pyramid
2014-08-14 11:05:54	george2	we already have a few apps, yeah.
2014-08-14 11:06:18	george2	plus the Django CCR, when I get around to doing that.
2014-08-14 11:07:19	george2	pyramid and django probably wouldn't be able to use the same user/authentication database, at least not easily.
2014-08-14 11:08:09	msx	no idea, i'm just a n00b repeating what he's hearing
2014-08-14 11:08:25	msx	george2: you probably do better don't listening 2 me :P

2014-08-14 11:09:36	george2	well totte's the Django guy here :)
2014-08-14 11:09:56	george2	afk for the weekend on a thursday... that's a long weekend :D
2014-08-14 11:10:12	msx	totte is the man!!!
2014-08-14 11:10:22	msx	totte! totte! totte!
2014-08-14 11:10:37	msx	when i grow up i want to be like him!
2014-08-14 11:11:01	george2	I'm guessing his scrollback won't even go this far. ZNC only saves the last 50 messages in each channel by default :p
2014-08-14 11:14:09	msx	to be totally frankly i got dissapointed with znc :(
2014-08-14 11:14:29	msx	i was about to try bip but i decided to just use same weechat as the bouncer
2014-08-14 11:14:48	msx	i found znc overly complicated, for no reason at all
2014-08-14 11:15:13	msx	or it might be just me, oc :D
2014-08-14 11:15:38	msx	AHAH
2014-08-14 11:20:49	george2	do you use weechat as your client then too?
2014-08-14 11:21:30	msx	weechat fanboy here <3
2014-08-14 11:22:15	george2	I like it more than irssi, but I'm still stuck on quassel myself :)
2014-08-14 11:22:36	george2	how do notifications work with weechat, do you just wave to watch the window?
2014-08-14 11:22:41	george2	*have to
2014-08-14 11:25:07	msx	george2: http://i.imgur.com/coqsFlh.jpg
2014-08-14 11:25:24	msx	george2: i use a plugin on the client, anotify
2014-08-14 11:27:14	george2	hm, so it gives you kde notifications or something?
2014-08-14 11:27:37	msx	exactly, it works via the notification system
2014-08-14 11:27:53	george2	cool
2014-08-14 11:28:07	msx	there are two or three notification plugins, i still have to try the rest
2014-08-14 11:28:17	george2	how's the scrollback? does it use flat files?
2014-08-14 11:29:13	george2	I idle in about a hundred channels, so quassel is starting to get pretty angry with me.
2014-08-14 11:29:19	msx	as flat as was the world before Columbus reached back europe
2014-08-14 11:29:31	george2	ha
2014-08-14 11:30:26	msx	well, quassel is really nice
2014-08-14 11:30:29	george2	not sure which is better, flat or db. my quassel db is currently using up quite a bit of my /home partition.
2014-08-14 11:30:58	george2	It is nice, but I've found it doesn't scale too well to a lot of channels.
2014-08-14 11:32:10	msx	george2: if you ask me, being oldschool as i am, there's nothing like plain text, everything else is post-modernist BS :P
2014-08-14 11:32:22	george2	:D

2014-08-17 13:37:07	KsenZ	[02:55:42] what happened with chakraos.org?
2014-08-17 13:37:07	KsenZ	[02:56:10] i can't open site
2014-08-17 13:37:07	KsenZ	[02:56:24] and no ping to host
2014-08-17 13:37:07	dmnmsc	[04:45:14] Hello
2014-08-17 13:37:07	dmnmsc	[04:45:19] No news from server?

2014-08-17 13:37:07	tumbler	[05:16:02] How are you??
2014-08-17 13:37:07	phoerious	[05:46:22] Is there any ETA when the servers will be back?
2014-08-17 13:37:07	phoerious	[05:49:25] Is this still the IPMI issue BTW? If yes, I'd recommend abandoning this hoster. A hoster where you have to accept outages for 3 days straight is not a good hoster.

2014-08-17 13:37:07	phoerious	[08:01:43] OMG we'll all die. Heretic! Burn systemd!

2014-08-17 13:37:07	dmnmsc	[08:03:00] haha I don't know but seems he is very angry and disappointed xD
2014-08-17 13:37:07	phoerious	[08:03:25] I just had a similar (although more fact-related) discussion with other people about systemd.
2014-08-17 13:37:07	phoerious	[08:03:37] So I'm not joining another argument about it. :-D
2014-08-17 13:37:07	phoerious	[08:05:42] Basically it all says "We want freedom, not systemd" and when you look at their definition of freedom it says "using something i have developed myself that does not work with anything else and is intentionally incompatible with any other system in the world, utterly patchy and looks like bare-metal Linux in the 90ies"
2014-08-17 13:37:07	phoerious	[08:06:21] Anyway, I don't think systemd is great, but a good start.
2014-08-17 13:37:07	dmnmsc	[08:08:45] systemd is a coup! I want init! was more robust xD
2014-08-17 13:37:07	phoerious	[08:17:36] dmnmsc: Don't forget patch in some self-written shell scripts for more performance and stability.

2014-08-17 13:37:07	roelof	[08:31:42] Second question : Which version of Ruby is aviable. I want to use Chakra as my main development for  Rails development
2014-08-17 13:37:07	phoerious	[08:32:53] roelof: The site seems to be down the third day in a row now. Server issues AFAIK. Haven't received an answer though when asking for an ETA when the server will be back up.
2014-08-17 13:37:07	roelof	[08:33:21] phoerious:  not good
2014-08-17 13:37:07	phoerious	[08:33:59] no
2014-08-17 13:37:07	roelof	[08:34:38] I hope Chakra will not loose new members
2014-08-17 13:37:07	dmnmsc	[08:36:28] hi roelof. Yes, we are down.. About ruby: ruby 1.9.3_p448-3

2014-08-17 13:37:07	phoerious	[08:38:03] dmnmsc: Do know then the server will be back up?
2014-08-17 13:37:07	dmnmsc	[08:38:20] phoerious: unfortunately not, no idea... :s
2014-08-17 13:37:07	phoerious	[08:38:37] I've been trying to reach CCR for three days now. Need to recompile some packages and upload a new version of mkvtoolnix-gui.
2014-08-17 13:37:07	Marquel	[09:49:41] hrm... how long does the reboot take that chakraos.org is still offline?
2014-08-17 13:37:07	ahjolinna	[09:50:32] Marquel: no idea
2014-08-17 13:37:07	ahjolinna	[09:50:54] hopefully its online on monday
2014-08-17 13:37:07	Marquel	[09:52:33] well, at least i can ask whether it is normal that octopi does not react on close-application requests?
2014-08-17 13:37:07	dmnmsc	[10:01:00] Marquel: ah, probably because is running mirror-check
2014-08-17 13:37:07	dmnmsc	[10:01:41] and seems you can't close Octopi while mirror-check is running
2014-08-17 13:37:07	Marquel	[10:02:36] dmnmsc: that is ... ungood. ctrl+q should be able to abort and quit the running process, at least as long as it is not currently modifying the system...

2014-08-17 13:37:07	fairc	[12:48:31] hey totte, are you still working on the server?
2014-08-17 13:37:07	dmnmsc	[12:50:06] fairc: according to chakra-devel ML: "Nothing new, still. The data center has been contacted repeatedly by Host1Plus. We'll be contacted by the billing department regarding a refund for this downtime."
2014-08-17 13:37:07	fairc	[12:51:01] ahh, its a hosting problem ... :-/
2014-08-17 13:37:07	fairc	[12:51:40] I was misleaded by the channel topic "... | Server reboot imminent, some services may not be available temporarily"
2014-08-17 13:37:07	george2	[12:51:48] seems to be more the data center's fault, but yeah
2014-08-17 13:37:07	george2	[12:52:05] it was supposed to be a quick reboot, but the machines never came back online
2014-08-17 13:37:07	dmnmsc	[12:52:19] fairc: and that was the plan, but seems reboot never started the server again
2014-08-17 13:37:07	fairc	[12:52:30] lol, ok
2014-08-17 13:37:07	_d3f	[12:55:50] the website an the ccr were on the same server?
2014-08-17 13:37:07	george2	[12:56:29] some parts of the ccr are, I think, but the database should be separate
2014-08-17 13:37:07	george2	[12:56:58] the problem is that all of the "servers" we have are actually VMs, and it's the host machine seems to be down.
2014-08-17 13:37:07	george2	[12:58:03] so even things that were on different servers, like the repos, are still down

2014-08-18 17:33:49	ahjolinna	[18:50:46] LanDi: plasma 5.1 arrives about in 2month
2014-08-18 17:33:49	ahjolinna	[18:52:52] I hope plasma 5.1 is stable enough
2014-08-18 17:33:49	LanDi	[18:53:11] not bad
2014-08-18 17:33:49	dmnmsc	[18:53:18] still no apps ported
2014-08-18 17:33:49	ahjolinna	[18:53:57] there are some
2014-08-18 17:33:49	dmnmsc	[19:02:03] at alpha stage
2014-08-18 17:33:49	ahjolinna	[19:02:33] but ported

2014-08-18 17:33:49	msx	[20:08:09] "KDE is attempting to do something no other desktop in Linux has tried to date—move toward the tablet and mobile device future while still producing a desktop experience that's familiar, functional, and infinitely customizable."
2014-08-18 17:33:49	ahjolinna	[20:11:06] msx: wow, go ars technica
2014-08-18 17:33:49	msx	[20:11:55] :D
2014-08-18 17:33:49	msx	[20:12:19] ars tech have been always a sort of serious news site
2014-08-18 17:33:49	msx	[20:13:29] "We're referring to an inevitable move to tablets and other form factors, but fear not. KDE seems poised to do what GNOME and Unity could not—branch out to other form factors without abandoning the traditional desktop."
2014-08-18 17:33:49	msx	[20:13:32] cool

2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:17:10] LOL
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:17:31] now i'm absolutely convinced the person who wrote that article is a kdelover xD
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:17:39] *that the
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:18:09] who in his right mind isnt?
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:18:32] :D
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:18:35] spectrwm++
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:18:53] ahjolinna: i'm using the whole kde stuff but spectrwm as my WM
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:19:06] i don't need a full-blown desktop anymore :D
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:19:22] traitor
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:20:27] lol
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:20:41] don't need such bloat anymore
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:21:24] msx: no excuses
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:26:06] it isn't an excuse
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:26:11] it's called 'evolution'
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:26:17] yes it is
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:26:59] "kde5" is evolution
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:27:38] or revolution
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:28:37] ahjolinna: no it isn't
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:28:40] 4 example
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:28:59] i use dolphin with balou, amarok, kdevelop, kompare and a lot of other apps
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:29:24] what i don't use is konsole (too heavy, no need for that, urxvt werkz great)
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:29:28] or the whole desktop
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:29:32] the desktop is BLOAT
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:29:43] no need to load such leviathan
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:29:52] spectrwm does it's job admirably
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:30:01] if not *better*
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:32:09] msx: plasma 5 is rewritten in qml and its hardware accelerated
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:33:05] ahjolinna: it's not a matter of system resources
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:33:34] kde does admirably there bearing in mind all the infrastrucuture it provides
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:33:47] my issue is with a "full-blown desktop"
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:33:54] why? 4 what? i don't need that
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:34:47] not to mention my system is using ~0.20 of cpu cycles since a while and i have amarok and chrome running
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:34:54] and chorme is specially heavy
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:35:13] chrome sucks, its really heavy now days
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:35:30] ahjolinna: with a good WM like spectrwm you don't need a full desktop
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:35:45] yes indeed is heavy but way better than firefox crap :D
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:35:49] chrome was light and fast longtime ago
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:35:58] firefox is better
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:36:06] I have no problems
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:36:07] ahjolinna: i've been using firefox since it was dubbed "Phenix"
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:36:18] no it isn't
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:36:21] ff is crap
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:36:36] tell me how
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:36:55] last good broser from mozilla foundation is was the mozilla browser and firefox 3.6.12
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:37:12] dear god no
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:37:24] from there everything went downhill lol
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:37:45] 3.6.x was all horrible, really bloated
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:37:54] like chrome is now
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:38:10] chrome is a heavyweight bc the sandboxing they use but you can deactivate it and you're done
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:38:32] ahjolinna: hahaha, wait for firefox to ship their new built-in sandboxing technology
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:38:34] hahaha
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:38:49] it will suck even more!
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:39:19] not to mention firefox uses way more cpu cycles than chrome when playing flash crap
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:39:33] and that you need to restart the browser after installing or removing an add-on
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:39:49] or the code inspector... ewww!
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:40:20] ahjolinna: but hey, firefox ships a nice 3d page-components renderer... that nobody uses lol
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:41:49] flash player is not firefox problem is adobe flashplayer problem ...chrome has its own...firefox will soon
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:42:35] and above all of that, i don't like mozilla anymore
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:42:49] they seems that widly lost their path
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:43:00] they aren't anymore the same cool people as used to be
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:43:34] they claim they are a lot of things they really aren't
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:43:48] and they are here for the $$$ fuck off the open web
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:44:21] that could be real years ago when mozilla was a cool non-profit corporation
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:45:06] the game has changed alot
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:45:15] and bc that they were the only ones who stood against microsoft and their crappy internet explorer we now can enjoy this open web
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:45:32] "open", lol! W3C has added DRM to html5 so fuck off openess!
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:45:51] ahjolinna: agreed, but not only that
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:46:49] I hate DRM...
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:48:10] I hate online DRM the most
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:50:27] msx: what distro do you use now?
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:50:57] s8321414: arch
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:51:23] :D
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:51:23] i installed it on last thursday and just finished setting it up as i like it
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:51:45] i was a bit rusty i must confess, after a year or so with chakra and them some months with ubuntu LOL
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:52:30] I like manjaro more than original arch though :P
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:53:00] no way!
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:53:02] lol
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:53:04] eewww!
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:53:16] i like chakra
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:53:38] but for some reason after curie everything went downhill with my laptop
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:53:44] I wonder what will be msx next distro? and how soon.. I bet on 1month
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:53:57] i hope not
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:54:04] I like chakra,too.I just say I like manjaro more than arch XD.
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:54:14] i indeed had installed blackarch repo
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:54:24] ahjolinna: gentoo XDD
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:54:26] so no need for kali for my pentesting needs even :D
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:54:51] s8321414: in fact was my second choice, first one was funtoo
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:55:07] but funtoo isn't going to adopt systemd anytime soon
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:55:07] :P
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:55:23] and after all, i don't really want to deal with so much compiling all the time
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:55:47] so arch was my natural choice, after all i've been running this os for some good 6 years
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:55:48] msx: or you can try debian.....unstable!
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:55:51] XD
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:56:04] eww debian xD
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:56:36] arch is more bleeding edge than sid yet same as stable than stable - although not equally tested
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:56:58] not to mention .deb packages are hell, just like .rpm and creating them is a pita
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:56:59] I don't like .deb and .rpm distro though...
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:57:03] XD
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:57:26] I know.... slackware
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:57:48] ahjolinna: Linux from scratch...
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:58:13] arch <3
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:58:45] pacman is great XD
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:58:53] i never should have left arch <3
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:59:13] msx: you will leave it again
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:59:17] in the sense that i'm now getting up to date with latest systemd and such
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[20:59:25] rolling distro is great!
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[20:59:27] my bet is on 1 month
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:59:49] ahjolinna: let's bet, if you lose you send me a bottle of Finlandia
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[20:59:52] ahjolinna: deal?
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[21:00:05] XDD
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[21:00:05] yeah right
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[21:00:14] ahh
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[21:00:17] pussy!
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[21:01:12] whaaat?!
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[21:01:51] s8321414: what pussy means? (in this context)
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[21:02:04] msx: you will just suffer thru it
2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[21:02:14] I don't what do you mean...
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[21:02:33] wuss
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[21:02:54] nössö in finnish

2014-08-18 17:33:50	s8321414	[21:03:46] :P
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[21:03:53] ahjolinna: but in the sense of "little girl" or just "cunt"?
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[21:04:14] btw, there isn't any sensible women here, right?
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[21:04:24] lol
2014-08-18 17:33:50	⚡	s8321414 [21:05:46] is 20 years old boy lol
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[21:06:11] hmm
2014-08-18 17:33:50	msx	[21:06:30] i just remember i didn't setup systemd to suspend when i close my laptop's lid
2014-08-18 17:33:50	ahjolinna	[21:08:05] msx: here is little bit of finnsh: little girl = neiti, cunt = kusipää, asshole = paskiainen/persläpi, dick = mulkku

2014-11-24 22:12:37	+AIDE	[11:44:00] Title: Steam Community :: Group Announcements :: METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES (at steamcommunity.com)
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ugjka	[11:44:50] why?
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:44:58]  Graphics: GeForce GTX 650 or above
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:45:15] I have GTX 560ti
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ugjka	[11:45:28] how much would it cost to upgrade
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ugjka	[11:45:30] ?
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:46:33] I would need to upgrade my motherboard and cpu also..if I bought a new gpu
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:46:50] so alot
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:47:34] I also need a new/bigger SSD
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:48:06] last time I played a mgs... world trade center was there.
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:48:18] so I need 1.5k €
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:49:14] I build a gaming rid for my cousing
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:49:15] cousin
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:49:36] she is having fun: http://i.imgur.com/VyZf0Qd.jpg
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:50:24] Israphel: what kind?
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:50:39] specially for the sims 4
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:51:01] I mean what components?
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:51:06] ohh
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:51:08] it's full amd
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:51:20] thats not a gaming rig
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ugjka	[11:51:29] Israphel: cool keyboard
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:51:33] full intel was about 2117 usd
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:51:39] that's just heater
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:52:04] full amd with ssd was about 992
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:52:12] hardware fanboys are BAD
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:52:19] and a bigger electricity bill
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:52:33] I would buy intel always but I can FORCE people to buy what I want
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:52:39] I cant*
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:53:07] so amd A10 7850k will do the trick
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:53:29] ugjka: thanks, it's an excellent keyboard
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:53:33] intel and nvidia is better thats a fact...sometime radeon is good but god their drivers are horrible even on windows they are bad
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:54:02] nvidia/amd has similar prices here, that wasn't the problem
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:54:06] the problem was: no discrete gpu
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:54:14] wow
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:54:18] so APU is the only exit
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:54:34] that's why they exist
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:55:07] do u know anything about hardware?
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:55:20] just asking
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:55:41] I know a lot
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:56:06] since I was 11
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:57:47] then u would know that nvidia and intel uses less energy and has less heat output (colder) than amd ..in general
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:58:02] do you know how to read?
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:58:10] energy IS NOT THE PROBLEM
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:58:20] we produce energy, we have cheap energy
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:58:25] we DON'T HAVE cheap hardware
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:58:51] we also have cheap energry
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:58:55] building a haswell i7 rig with nvidia and ssd will rise to $18.000 AR, thats more than $2000 USD
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[11:59:22] and hardware is ok price
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:59:27] you cut the price by half by using an APU
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:59:33] with no real video card
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[11:59:51] so, in the end, less energy ANYWAY
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:00:31] I use a haswell pentium Fanless because I care about the noise
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:00:36] but I don't play
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:01:44] do you know about nvidias gpu boost v2 ?
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:02:24] yes and what with that
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:03:33] less heat output and less energy they use more u can "overclock" them
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:04:08] fine, but we were talking about a 11 yo sims player
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:04:20] I'm not
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:04:32] every piece a hardware has a place to be
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:04:39] you can't build every pc exactly the same
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:04:41] we are not IBM
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:04:47] we are not in the 70s
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:07:15] I cant never buy AMD crap, way to many driver problems...plus hardware is from ok to crap
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:10:32] but only they build apus
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:10:47] they have a solution for a problem
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:10:57] i dont care
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:11:08] their drivers are still horrible
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:11:13] at least on linux
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:11:18] you should, you should have in mind every piece of hardware
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:11:29] alot of problems
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:11:36] the more you know
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:11:38] the better you are
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:12:09] if we talk about drivers, they both suck
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:12:16] one is bad, the other is closed
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:12:26] and life without KMS is not life.
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:13:10] I know few Linux devs/uers who have tried amd and said that they will never touch AMD again. because the experience was so bad
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:13:36] I what Linus said:
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:13:40] and*
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:13:51] nvidia, fuck you.
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:13:53] for example cmplayer dev and teo- (calamares dev)
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:14:13] the idea of using linux+amd is bad from the start
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:14:21] but apu + windows + games = profit.
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:14:45] intel + openElec + big tv = profit
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:14:48] yeah and Linus is now happy that  nvidia has become alot better
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:16:29] nvidia is becoming better all the time, amd is not
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:16:52] they had to
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:17:01] AMD have almost nobody left working on open source/linux
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:17:21] amd will win money with MS and Sony
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:17:32] so they are doing shit.
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:17:49] but steamos gave nvidia a chance
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:17:56] to suck less
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:19:24] its AMD own fault that they don't have any features
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:20:27] they don't care
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:20:28] that's clear
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:20:34] my point
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:20:39] if you don't try you can't fail
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:20:51] if you try and fail, you suck. If you don't try, you're just evil.
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:22:08] Nvidia and Intel is pushing the industry forward, unlike AMD
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:22:30] that's why I use plain intel
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:22:38] kms working right
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:22:54] I only use intel and nvidia
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:23:02] nvidia still lacks KMS
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:23:05] I'll keep waiting.
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:23:22] btw. what ram do use?
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:24:21] I use hyperX
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:24:39] its good
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:24:56] I use corsair dominator
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:25:11] corsair and g.skill are common here for gaming
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:25:15] and kingston for everything else
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:25:48] samsung evo is the most sold SSD here
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:26:16]  Dominator Platinum to be exact
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:26:21] amd 5xxx and 6xxx are the most sold video cards because of Bitcoin mining
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:26:32] thousands of them only for mining
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:26:34] 200e for 16gb
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:27:22] Corsair 16GB (2 x 8GB) Dominator Platinum, DDR3 1866MHz, CL9  is now 269.00 €
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:27:59] my ssd is OCZ agility 3
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:28:02] 120gb
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:28:03] let me check here
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:28:53] corsair dominator platinum is about € 940
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:29:13] nice country
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:29:51] ocz agility 3 120 is about €187
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:30:24] I bought my samsung evo 250 GB in miami for about 100 USD
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:30:53] here is about 400 USD
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:31:17] the same thing
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:31:55] Israphel: how much is OCZ 240GB SSD-levy, Vector 150, 2,5", SATA III, 550/530MB
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:32:06] here its 159.00 €
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:32:48] looks like this http://images.jimms.fi/8/7/115287_800x600_1.jpg
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:32:53] 400 usd so €320
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:33:21] ocz revodrive for the pci-e slot is about €1215
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:34:21] it's kinda easy to get the ssd from miami because it can be hidden
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:34:30] OCZ 960GB RevoDrive 350, PCI-E SSD, 1800/1700 MB/s  is 1240.00 €
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:34:31] but that's not the case with bigger stuff
2014-11-24 22:12:37	Israphel	[12:35:03] ocz pci-e are the REAL THING
2014-11-24 22:12:37	ahjolinna	[12:35:29] OCZ 120GB RevoDrive 3 PCI-E SSD, 975/875 MB/s  is 306.00 €
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:36:21] plus a gigabyte x99m-gaming 5
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:36:27] I can feel it
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:37:50] my feedly is empty... damn
2014-11-24 22:12:38	ahjolinna	[12:38:18] I only find new versions with DDR4
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:38:22] main datacenter power went down on the capital city so I can't work
2014-11-24 22:12:38	ahjolinna	[12:38:33] like Gigabyte X99 Gaming 5, LGA2011-v3, Intel X99, DDR4, ATX
2014-11-24 22:12:38	ahjolinna	[12:38:38] 280.00 €
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:38:49] exactly that
2014-11-24 22:12:38	ugjka	[12:38:51] Israphel: does electronics in your country have some crazy tax?
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:38:52] if you like mATX
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:39:04] ugjka: yes and no
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:39:23] ugjka: we have the biggest TAX for whatever, not only electronics
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:39:31] and also we have a dollar restrictions
2014-11-24 22:12:38	ahjolinna	[12:39:34] -_
2014-11-24 22:12:38	ahjolinna	[12:39:36] -
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:39:39] and a total customs shutdown
2014-11-24 22:12:38	ahjolinna	[12:39:39] -_-
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:39:47] you can't buy even a flashlight from china
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:39:56] a $0.1 led flashlight
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:40:05] or a $2 pony toy, in my case
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:40:34] every cargo from "the world" stays in customs for "a while"
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:40:52] but most of the stuff HAVE TO be build here
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:41:11] nokias, motorolas. lgs, samsungs... all of them, build here.
2014-11-24 22:12:38	ahjolinna	[12:41:22] Israphel: how much is Sandisk 1.6TB Optimus SSD, 2.5", SAS, 500/500 MB/s
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:41:27] so we don't know the asian/american versions
2014-11-24 22:12:38	ahjolinna	[12:41:36] Israphel: here it is 3550.00 €
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:41:48] not available yet
2014-11-24 22:12:38	ugjka	[12:42:08] not built yet :P
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:42:19] biggest SSD is 840 evo 1 TB
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:42:43] ugjka: if your company (ie samsung) build something (ie galaxies) they can bring something from asia (ie ssd)
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:42:58] so every company MUST build something here to sell their products
2014-11-24 22:12:38	Israphel	[12:43:12] Dell build inspirons here, but they also sell Latitudes
2014-11-24 22:12:38	ugjka	[12:43:19] is that some kind of evil market protection scheme?
