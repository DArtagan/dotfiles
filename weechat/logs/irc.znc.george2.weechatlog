2014-07-26 18:51:21	george2	yeah, that they shut down?
2014-07-26 18:52:25	dartagan	yeah, rather precipitously and strongly
2014-07-26 18:53:07	dartagan	the site warns that truecrypt is not secure, though the recent security audit said they were clear
2014-07-26 18:53:58	george2	I saw a bunch of people were trying to find a secret message that it was really the NSA that shut them down :)
2014-07-26 18:54:08	dartagan	hehe
2014-07-26 18:54:12	dartagan	yay conspiracy
2014-07-26 18:55:30	george2	so hows things? I heard you were in germany?
2014-07-26 18:55:50	dartagan	things are mostly good
2014-07-26 18:55:58	dartagan	I was in Germany
2014-07-26 18:56:13	dartagan	and across a lot of Europe
2014-07-26 18:56:26	george2	cool
2014-07-26 18:56:27	dartagan	I travelled around for almost six weeks
2014-07-26 18:56:40	dartagan	It was definitely one of the best things I've done
2014-07-26 18:57:51	george2	did you stay in hotels, or what?
2014-07-26 18:58:00	dartagan	hostels
2014-07-26 18:58:23	dartagan	Which are a cross between hotel and summer camp cabin
2014-07-26 18:58:49	dartagan	Room full of 4-14 bunks
2014-07-26 18:59:08	dartagan	reasonable price, easy to check in and out of for a few nights
2014-07-26 18:59:50	dartagan	also nice - hostels are full of fellow travelers to talk to and swap advice
2014-07-26 19:00:04	george2	makes sense
2014-07-26 19:00:45	dartagan	I mostly travelled by train, which was also amazing.  You just walk into the station, walk onto the train, and away you go to another country
2014-07-26 19:01:28	george2	so which country, or town, or whatever was the most... fun? interesting? I can't imagine being able to just go from country to country like that
2014-07-26 19:01:35	george2	the US is a little large for that
2014-07-26 19:05:16	dartagan	My favorite city was Venice.  Super neat place - it really is buildings on top of the water, no land except on islands they build to make parks out of
2014-07-26 19:05:39	dartagan	Lots of winding alleys and bridges everywhere
2014-07-26 19:06:31	george2	did you go on a gondola?
2014-07-26 19:06:32	dartagan	London was great, my third country in and a nice change to return to speaking English
2014-07-26 19:06:51	dartagan	They're museums are superb and free
2014-07-26 19:06:57	dartagan	*Their
2014-07-26 19:07:36	dartagan	Munich was probably the nicest city.  Everything was just really clean and nice
2014-07-26 19:08:22	dartagan	That's kinda three highlights, but everyplace was great for its own features
2014-07-26 19:08:36	dartagan	I'm definitely planning on traveling again
2014-07-26 19:09:10	dartagan	No gondola, alas
2014-07-26 19:09:13	george2	did you have time to learn any new languages? I've heard it's easier if you're actually in a country that speaks it
2014-07-26 19:09:37	dartagan	But they also have "water buses", which I rode on all the time.  One of my favorite activities
2014-07-26 19:10:01	george2	also, I should probably know where Munich is, but I'm afraid my geography is not too good :)
2014-07-26 19:10:10	dartagan	I was most concerned about language when starting out
2014-07-26 19:10:18	dartagan	Munich is in southern Germany
2014-07-26 19:10:48	dartagan	When we think of stereotypical German food and dress, it's pretty much the region of Bavaria where Munich is the captial
2014-07-26 19:11:40	dartagan	I took French in high school and that's it
2014-07-26 19:12:18	dartagan	French and English cognates were useful for Italy and Spain
2014-07-26 19:12:38	dartagan	since those languages are all latin/romantic languages
2014-07-26 19:13:10	dartagan	So in those places you can pick up little words and get along fine
2014-07-26 19:13:30	dartagan	Most people I dealt with knew some English as well (cause it's the universal tourist language)
2014-07-26 19:14:09	dartagan	It got hard in Amsterdam, Germany, Denmark, Iceland
2014-07-26 19:14:19	dartagan	I had know idea whatsoever how to pronounce their words
2014-07-26 19:14:29	dartagan	*no
2014-07-26 19:15:24	george2	ooo, Iceland?
2014-07-26 19:18:52	dartagan	Yeah, it was recommended to me by a friend.  Flying Iceland Air back from Europe, they allow multi-day layovers in Iceland
2014-07-26 19:19:14	dartagan	It's pretty baren
2014-07-26 19:19:36	dartagan	Feels like a cross between one of our mountain towns and a fishing town
2014-07-26 19:20:01	dartagan	To be fair, prior to this trip I've not spend any time in coastal towns
2014-07-26 19:20:20	dartagan	*spent
2014-07-26 19:20:38	dartagan	The stangest feature was the daylight
2014-07-26 19:20:53	george2	ha, I was just about to ask about that
2014-07-26 19:21:02	dartagan	At midnight it was like sunset
2014-07-26 19:21:09	dartagan	And that's as dark as it got
2014-07-26 19:21:30	dartagan	Totally threw off my sense of time
2014-07-26 19:22:02	dartagan	I can imagine things would get really tough in the winter
2014-07-26 19:22:40	george2	was this in Iceland, or denmark, or both? I'm not sure which is further north
2014-07-26 19:23:25	dartagan	Iceland is further north
2014-07-26 19:23:57	dartagan	The part of denmark I was in had just a little longer hours than normal
2014-07-26 19:24:34	george2	ah denmark is below the netherlands, nevermind.
2014-07-26 19:25:18	dartagan	just above netherlands
2014-07-26 19:25:28	dartagan	Netherlands are on the top left of Gernamy
2014-07-26 19:25:36	dartagan	Denmarks on the top top of germany
2014-07-26 19:25:43	george2	well now I'm confused.
2014-07-26 19:26:28	george2	hm, netherlands are not what I thought.
2014-07-26 19:27:07	dartagan	Sweden and Norway up above everything
2014-07-26 19:27:09	george2	Scandanavia maybe?
2014-07-26 19:27:16	dartagan	Ja
2014-07-26 19:27:23	dartagan	That's totally the one
2014-07-26 19:29:02	dartagan	So other than that super trip, things are pretty mundane
2014-07-26 19:29:12	george2	ha
2014-07-26 19:29:23	george2	other than the traveling the world part :)
2014-07-26 19:31:32	dartagan	yeah
2014-07-26 19:31:55	dartagan	The last two weeks are the earnest beginning to my job search
2014-07-26 19:32:02	dartagan	I don't like job searching
2014-07-26 19:32:21	george2	it's not terribly fun, no
2014-07-26 19:34:42	dartagan	So to turn the original question - hows things?
2014-07-26 19:37:35	george2	oh, not much happening around here. Evan's leaving, so I guess there'll be a new intern starting. I'm busy as usual, but not so much work as during the semester.
2014-07-26 19:37:59	george2	actually taking Arabic next semester, as that's the only language class I could get into, so that should be interesting :)
2014-07-26 19:38:10	dartagan	interesting indeed
2014-07-26 19:38:16	dartagan	have you done a language previously?
2014-07-26 19:38:51	dartagan	(I've been called to dinner, ah the perks of living at home, sorry, be back in a bit)
2014-07-26 19:38:54	george2	officially I've done 3 years of Spanish, but I don't remember any of it.
2014-07-26 19:39:02	george2	alright, have fun

2014-07-29 15:45:17	dartagan	I think I'll start by trying it out on my music collection

2014-08-10 21:05:17	dartagan_	yeah :)
2014-08-10 21:05:44	dartagan_	on a different topic, have you ever worked with python and serial communications?
2014-08-10 21:06:09	george2	nope
2014-08-10 21:06:13	george2	arduino stuff?
2014-08-10 21:06:24	dartagan_	yep
2014-08-10 21:06:32	dartagan_	rats
2014-08-14 14:58:03	george2	[13:33:30] hey. I'm working on the acmx django site, and I want to have "projects" with "teams" of "users"... how should I set up the models for that?
2014-08-14 14:59:34	dartagan	are the teams associated with projects?
2014-08-14 14:59:34	ℹ 	george2: No such nick/channel
2014-08-14 15:01:39	dartagan	are the teams associated with projects?
2014-08-14 15:12:35	george2	Yeah, each project has a team of people working on it
2014-08-14 15:12:52	george2	I'm not sure if teams should even be a model, just a list of users somehow
2014-08-14 15:14:07	dartagan	thinking...
2014-08-14 15:16:19	dartagan	Generally I put my user authentication in an app of its own, utilizing a package by my friend: https://github.com/fusionbox/django-authtools
2014-08-14 15:16:57	dartagan	See my project for example: https://github.com/DArtagan/teetimer
2014-08-14 15:17:34	dartagan	Projects could have a many-to-many relationship to users
2014-08-14 15:17:50	dartagan	That relationship is representative of the team
2014-08-14 15:18:13	dartagan	Are teams called out by their own team names or some other unique feature?
2014-08-14 15:18:16	george2	hm. I'm thinking about using allauth and only allowing registration/login with OAuth2 through gmail and github... any idea if that would work with authtools?
2014-08-14 15:18:35	george2	I don't think the teams need names, it would just be the group of people working on that project
2014-08-14 15:19:47	dartagan	Yeah, I don't think a team model is necessary then
2014-08-14 15:20:03	george2	many to many makes sense. do I need to put a field in both users and projects then?
2014-08-14 15:20:07	dartagan	I'd place the many-to-many relationship in the project model, linking to the users
2014-08-14 15:20:14	dartagan	just project
2014-08-14 15:20:34	george2	ok, thanks
2014-08-14 15:23:47	dartagan	Reading through allauth, I think you
2014-08-14 15:24:03	dartagan	I think you'd just use allauth, no django-authtools
2014-08-14 15:24:37	dartagan	authtools is useful when you need to have a user management framework, but it looks like allauth or the 3rd parties covers that
2014-08-14 15:24:58	george2	cool
