2014-07-26 14:08:41		Description:
2014-07-26 14:08:41		Add vi/vim-like modes and keybindings to WeeChat.
2014-07-26 14:08:41		Usage:
2014-07-26 14:08:41		To switch to Normal mode, press Esc or Ctrl+Space.
2014-07-26 14:08:41		Two bar items are provided:
2014-07-26 14:08:41		    mode_indicator: shows the currently active mode (e.g. "NORMAL").
2014-07-26 14:08:41		    vi_buffer: shows partial commands (e.g. "df").
2014-07-26 14:08:41		You can add them to your input bar. For example, using iset.pl:
2014-07-26 14:08:41		    /iset weechat.bar.input.items
2014-07-26 14:08:41		    <Alt+Enter>
2014-07-26 14:08:41		    Add [mode_indicator]+ at the start, and ,[vi_buffer] at the end.
2014-07-26 14:08:41		Final result example:
2014-07-26 14:08:41		    "[mode_indicator]+[input_prompt]+(away),[input_search],[input_paste],input_text,[vi_buffer]"
2014-07-26 14:08:41		To switch back to Insert mode, you can use i, a, A, etc.
2014-07-26 14:08:41		To execute an Ex command, simply precede it with a ':' while in normal mode, for example: ":h" or ":s/foo/bar".
