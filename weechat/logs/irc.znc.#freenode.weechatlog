2014-07-26 14:08:30	paramm	[14:05:58] hello. I am looking for irc client that will be connected all the time to irc and I will be able to connect to it to read all messages from entire day. anyone know any?
2014-07-26 14:08:30	qwertyuiop	[14:06:03] Atque: I've seen users break the ToS. Staff did absolutely nothing.
2014-07-26 14:08:30	TheMesquito	[14:06:09] Not TOS, but polices
2014-07-26 14:08:30	Chiyo	[14:06:19] paramm, you might want to look into a bouncer / BNC / ZNC
2014-07-26 14:08:30	qwertyuiop	[14:06:23] paramm: depends on OS
2014-07-26 14:08:30	qwertyuiop	[14:06:29] Or get a Bouncer
2014-07-26 14:08:30	Chiyo	[14:06:35] paramm, I think you can also use weechat in tmux if you have linux or something
2014-07-26 14:08:30	butcha	[14:06:36] most client will do that, as long as they keep running
2014-07-26 14:08:30	Atque	[14:06:48] qwertyuiop: I am sure they are competent and will act as they ought however that may be.
2014-07-26 14:08:30	paramm	[14:07:15] well the client will be running on archlinux on raspberry pi
2014-07-26 14:08:30	paramm	[14:07:36] and I will want to connect to it from windows client from work
2014-07-26 14:08:30	Chiyo	[14:08:22] paramm, look into running a ZNC on it, or a relay client like irssi-proxy or weechat-relay

2014-11-24 22:12:39	gry	[17:26:29] use xchat, networks, edit, freenode, [edit], enter whatever desired there (you may have to untick 'use global settings for this network')
2014-11-24 22:12:39	bazhang	[17:27:23] or use a maintained version: hexchat

2014-11-24 22:12:39	Tintle	[17:32:55] gry , Svetlana , help
2014-11-24 22:12:39	patate	[17:34:32] Tintle: dont put your bot on channels without ask permission
2014-11-24 22:12:39	patate	[17:34:41] and you will not being banned
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gry	[17:36:25] Tintle: what patate said. I feel it's about time to tread a bit more lightly everywhere (not a first time a similar thing happens, and they're straightforward to avoid).
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gry	[17:37:11] Tintle: sounds a bit easier if you have just two accounts and have them both under reasonable control, too. For instance, the bot shouldn't run in an irc client that looks the same as your main IRC client. :)
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Tintle	[17:37:12] patate , I don't put my bot there.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Tintle	[17:37:19] That was eta__
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Tintle	[17:37:21] not me.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gry	[17:37:31] Tintle: how did they put your bot there then?
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Tintle	[17:37:40] Anyone can use the bot for joining and part channels.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gry	[17:38:26] Tintle: would encourage to disable that then, or make it nag you so that you review the invite and only join the bot then.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	phy1729	[17:38:54] Or only allow channel operators do do that
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gry	[17:39:08] suspect the bot doesn't know who the chanops are, in advance. :)
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Tintle	[17:39:20] ok
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Tintle	[17:39:31] I'm telling the chanops the problem.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gry	[17:39:33] although checking that by hand could be a good idea when you're reviewing an invite.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gry	[17:39:55] I doubt they want to hear about it - they don't want the bot in there, you don't want it there either, so I'd be inclined to not approach them.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	phy1729	[17:39:56] it can always do a query to chanserv, rate limited of course

2014-11-24 22:12:39	darsie	[17:53:22] Can you please drop ##vegans ? It forwards to ##nutrition where ppl have been banned for talking about veganism. It would be better to forward to ##vegan , but there's actually no need to have ##vegans and ##vegan . ##vegans was  Last used  : Feb 06 11:47:49 2010 (4 years, 41 weeks, 5 days, 13:03:03 ago)
2014-11-24 22:12:39	southeast	[17:53:37] tobleronegordon, i think that would be better addressed in ##grammar :)
2014-11-24 22:12:39	tobleronegordon	[17:53:56] oh no at the time, it needed to be addressed here
2014-11-24 22:12:39	tobleronegordon	[17:54:07] it made me cringe lol

2014-11-24 22:12:39	AGinsberg	[17:57:34] southeast: You're telling people they are being off-topic for single lines of off-topic chat, it's annoying and unneeded.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	tobleronegordon	[17:57:44] hear hear AG

2014-11-24 22:12:39	+roo	[18:04:37] AGinsberg: bing cache? :)
2014-11-24 22:12:39	AGinsberg	[18:04:44] <+christel> if the channel is extremely busy with help requests we may ask that offtopic chatter is reduced until we've dealt with such requests but generally speaking it is perfectly fine to converse, even encouraged :)

2014-11-24 22:12:39	southeast	[18:28:08] Polish your catalyst skills. The catalyst role is key to keeping channel interactions friendly and efficient. If you see people not adhering to the rules, take them to query and catalyze. Anyone can catalyze - you do not need power, privilege or social standing to do it.

2014-11-24 22:12:39	Superzerocool	[18:51:47] Chiyo, the command returns "The email address is considered invalid." :S
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Chiyo	[18:51:56] ahh, there isn't an email attached to that account :(
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Chiyo	[18:52:09] (see /msg NickServ info Superzerocool )
2014-11-24 22:12:39	b	[18:52:31] Superzerocool: Check your IRC client's config or logs that might contain a password if you don't remember it.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Chiyo	[18:53:10] Superzerocool, if that fails (what b said) you can ask for the account to be dropped, but note that that will also remove any channel access you might have
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Superzerocool	[18:53:34] b, I'm using my password and the NickServ returns Invalid password for Superzerocool. :|

2014-11-24 22:12:39	darsie	[19:35:32] If we do /mode ##vegan +F' and '/msg chanserv set ##vegans mlock +if ##vegan', will the forward still work when we do '/mode ##vegan -F' ?
2014-11-24 22:12:39	auscompgeek	[19:36:05] darsie: yes, but you wouldn't need +F on the channel in the first place
2014-11-24 22:12:39	fwilson	[19:36:12] yes, but it might just be easier to op yourself in ##vegan then make the forward
2014-11-24 22:12:39	darsie	[19:36:43] fwilson: the ##vegans owner doesn't see to want to op someone in ##vegans.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	darsie	[19:37:05] auscompgeek: It seems we need +F, or op in both channels.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	auscompgeek	[19:38:54] darsie: that's an oversimplification of things
2014-11-24 22:12:39	darsie	[19:39:10] Possibly, I'm no expert op.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	auscompgeek	[19:39:27] essentially, the "can forward to channel" check just checks whether you're op or the channel is +F
2014-11-24 22:12:39	auscompgeek	[19:40:02] ChanServ does that check when you mlock, I believe.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	darsie	[19:40:22] auscompgeek: We got this error message: Invalid value ##vegan for mode +f.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	auscompgeek	[19:40:29] hmm, gimme a second.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	auscompgeek	[19:41:26] darsie: no, it works fine. just op yourself in the target channel (which you would have to do to /mode +F anyway)
2014-11-24 22:12:39	darsie	[19:41:50] auscompgeek: Yeah, but the ##vegans founder isn't op in ##vegan.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	auscompgeek	[19:42:27] darsie: it doesn't have to be the founder that sets the mlock, I believe.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	darsie	[19:42:46] auscompgeek: There's noone op in both channels.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	+thomas	[19:45:00] If the ##vegans founder doesn't want his channel forwarded to ##vegan he doesn't have to have it forwarded.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	darsie	[19:45:21] thomas: He wants it.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	+thomas	[19:45:36] darsie: then he has to OP someone in his channel, that's all there is to if.

2014-11-24 22:12:39	darsie	[19:45:51] *sigh*
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gwillen	[19:45:56] darsie: just test with +F
2014-11-24 22:12:39	auscompgeek	[19:46:01] giving the +s flag would work as well
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gwillen	[19:46:02] darsie: and see if it works after you remove +F
2014-11-24 22:12:39	auscompgeek	[19:46:23] gwillen: existing forwards work after -F or deop
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gwillen	[19:46:24] darsie: for that matter, just leave +F; most channels don't ahve a big problem with troll-forwards
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gwillen	[19:46:34] darsie: ok, so if you believe auscompgeek, there you go
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gwillen	[19:46:37] +F will work the way you want it to
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gwillen	[19:46:48] and you can ignore all the people failing to understand your problem :-)

2014-11-24 22:12:39	gry	[20:22:10] i find it hard to believe that a country banned a word

2014-11-24 22:12:39	Chiyo	[20:31:19] isn't it "using a secure connection"?

2014-11-24 22:12:39	gry	[20:31:38] phy1729: not after, it is shown in the middle of whois (312, 671, 378 (if whoising yourself), 317 (idle time), 330 (if authed), 318 (end of whois))
2014-11-24 22:12:39	phy1729	[20:31:54] I meant after I do a /whois
2014-11-24 22:12:39	gry	[20:32:05] it is *inside* of the whois output
2014-11-24 22:12:39	phy1729	[20:32:13] right

2014-11-24 22:12:39	unlockus	[22:02:57] hello good morning to everyone (is morning here :)
2014-11-24 22:12:39	xris	[22:03:23] having issues with #mythtv telling a user he's banned when I'm pretty sure he's not (at least as far as I can tell from the IP ranges, etc).  apparently this happens occasionally with our channel. Any ideas how to fix it?
2014-11-24 22:12:39	binarymunk	[22:04:11] hello i would like to get a cloak please! Can anyone help me with this?
2014-11-24 22:12:39	tallguy	[22:04:31] wait binarymunk
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Myself	[22:04:43] xris: Can you look at the ban list and figure out which mask he's matching? Might've been an overly-broad ban applied accidentally. (I feel like there should be a tool that tells you which mask someone matches, but I'm new here..)
2014-11-24 22:12:39	xris	[22:05:08] Myself: I did my best to check IPs and didn't see anything that should have matched
2014-11-24 22:12:39	rmeden	[22:05:17] btw, I just got here too
2014-11-24 22:12:39	xris	[22:05:29] according to other channel admins, this happens occasionally with our channel and someone in here knows how to fix it.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	xris	[22:05:36] fwiw rmeden is the user in question
2014-11-24 22:12:39	⚡	rmeden [22:06:10] ponders the concept of being called a user :)

2014-11-24 22:12:39	rmeden	[22:06:43] wow.. everyone in Houston?

2014-11-24 22:12:39	xris	[22:06:57] interesting, wonder how I missed that.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	rmeden	[22:07:01] I'm in Houston right now
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Jason	[22:07:04] rmeden: no, hsd doesn't mean houston

2014-11-24 22:12:39	Jason	[22:07:16] probably
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Jason	[22:07:21] definitely not houston
2014-11-24 22:12:39	jlotonah	[22:07:28] tx = texas
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Jason	[22:07:35] thank you for clarifying that
2014-11-24 22:12:39	phy1729	[22:07:36] it's hds not hsd

2014-11-24 22:12:39	rmeden	[22:07:41] not even an exclusion for Austin?
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Jason	[22:07:42] hds?  are you sure?

2014-11-24 22:12:39	+thomas	[22:07:56] hsd, was a typo
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Jason	[22:07:58] i think thomas just mistyped.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	⚡	phy1729 [22:08:08] assumed thomas's copy pasted it
2014-11-24 22:12:39	+thomas	[22:08:16] I didn't
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Myself	[22:08:23] austin is a little slice of california plunked into cowboyland, I love it so much.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	xris	[22:08:39] thomas: thanks for finding that.  Not sure how I missed that.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Myself	[22:08:46] You know you're nearing austin when the barbecue billboards get punctuated with coffee-shop billboards.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	rmeden	[22:08:56] :)
2014-11-24 22:12:39	+thomas	[22:09:06] xris: np, I suggest just narrowing that ban down to match who was intended to be banned
2014-11-24 22:12:39	rmeden	[22:09:23] or I'll just leave Houston
2014-11-24 22:12:39	rmeden	[22:09:28] (doing that Wed anyway)
2014-11-24 22:12:39	xris	[22:09:29] yeah, doubt anyone remembers why it was added.  looks like a ton of bans added at that same time.
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Jason	[22:09:35] rmeden: it's /texas/
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Jason	[22:09:42] any comcast user in texas
2014-11-24 22:12:39	rmeden	[22:09:49] yea, but I"m not comcast at home
2014-11-24 22:12:39	Jason	[22:09:51] xris: it might have been a netjoin
