2014-07-26 14:08:30	paramm	[14:05:58] hello. I am looking for irc client that will be connected all the time to irc and I will be able to connect to it to read all messages from entire day. anyone know any?
2014-07-26 14:08:30	qwertyuiop	[14:06:03] Atque: I've seen users break the ToS. Staff did absolutely nothing.
2014-07-26 14:08:30	TheMesquito	[14:06:09] Not TOS, but polices
2014-07-26 14:08:30	Chiyo	[14:06:19] paramm, you might want to look into a bouncer / BNC / ZNC
2014-07-26 14:08:30	qwertyuiop	[14:06:23] paramm: depends on OS
2014-07-26 14:08:30	qwertyuiop	[14:06:29] Or get a Bouncer
2014-07-26 14:08:30	Chiyo	[14:06:35] paramm, I think you can also use weechat in tmux if you have linux or something
2014-07-26 14:08:30	butcha	[14:06:36] most client will do that, as long as they keep running
2014-07-26 14:08:30	Atque	[14:06:48] qwertyuiop: I am sure they are competent and will act as they ought however that may be.
2014-07-26 14:08:30	paramm	[14:07:15] well the client will be running on archlinux on raspberry pi
2014-07-26 14:08:30	paramm	[14:07:36] and I will want to connect to it from windows client from work
2014-07-26 14:08:30	Chiyo	[14:08:22] paramm, look into running a ZNC on it, or a relay client like irssi-proxy or weechat-relay
