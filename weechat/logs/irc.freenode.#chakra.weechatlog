2014-04-17 14:41:25	AlmAck	totte: is important that we have a support for that :-) otherwise will be a mess
2014-04-17 14:41:32	AlmAck	or service
2014-04-17 14:41:43	totte	They were pretty quick to respond.
2014-04-17 14:42:50	totte	The RAID controller is a bit slow though. I've never used hardware RAID before so I don't have anything to compare with - but still...
2014-04-17 14:43:04	totte	What kernel is in stable now?
2014-04-17 14:44:19	AlmAck	totte: yes the kernel is in stable
2014-04-17 14:44:33	totte	No I mean, what version?
2014-04-17 14:44:59	AlmAck	Linux chakra-pc 3.12.15-1-CHAKRA
2014-04-17 14:45:51	totte	Thanks, I forget how to use AIDE so I just set the topic manually nowadays.

2014-04-21 13:32:30	dmnmsc_	pure QT/KDE distro. If you want GTK, just enable the repo.
2014-04-21 13:32:58	DiscipleOfDante	ShalokShalom: Chakra is geared towards KDE/Qt purists
2014-04-21 13:33:06	dmnmsc_	Someone could come here thinking about pure QT/KDE distro and install software from extra by accident.
2014-04-21 13:33:17	DiscipleOfDante	So an option to keep the system completely GTK free is enabled by default
2014-04-21 13:33:19	dmnmsc_	If you enable extra, you know will be gtk apps
2014-04-21 13:33:44	ShalokShalom	"Someone could come here thinking about pure QT/KDE distro and install software from extra by accident." Serious ?
2014-04-21 13:33:57	ShalokShalom	o.O
2014-04-21 13:33:58	dmnmsc_	who knows... xD
2014-04-21 13:34:04	ShalokShalom	wtf ?
2014-04-21 13:34:53	ShalokShalom	when the repos are enabled, i still be able to keep my system gtk free
2014-04-21 13:35:09	ShalokShalom	it is just a challenge for a newbie, to enable them
2014-04-21 13:35:21	ShalokShalom	so chakra choose, to be unfriendly to newbies ?
2014-04-21 13:36:38	dmnmsc_	is not unfriedly for newbies if they like to read forum, wiki and Chakra stuff
2014-04-21 13:37:15	DiscipleOfDante	IT is literally opening a text file and removing a couple pound signs
2014-04-21 13:37:19	ShalokShalom	you know, some users want a OS to use, they are called users
2014-04-21 13:37:27	DiscipleOfDante	Chakra is intended for users willing to learn
2014-04-21 13:37:30	DiscipleOfDante	You know that right?

2014-04-21 15:08:52	DiscipleOfDante	KDE is great but I think Cinnamon, once it is more mature, will be a truly solid contender
2014-04-21 15:10:31	truko22	:D
2014-04-21 15:11:40	truko22	I have never used cinnamon
2014-04-21 15:11:54	DiscipleOfDante	It is already got some features that beat out anything KDE has (cough cough configurable menu beats homerun) like its handling of applets and extensions and themes and whatnot is slightly superior to KDEs in that it allows a

2014-04-21 15:13:15	DiscipleOfDante	It has the benefits of forking from GNOME without the drawback of being made by GNOME
2014-04-21 15:14:18	DiscipleOfDante	Would you like the wallpaper?
2014-04-21 15:14:26	DiscipleOfDante	I have a slideshow of butts for wallpapers

2014-04-21 15:20:25	DiscipleOfDante	Anyway thenthing I like about Cinnamon is that, unlike KDE, all of those extra features that are so costly to RAM and whatnot in KDE will be extensions for Cinnamon, allowing me to only have the features I would use and want installed
2014-04-21 15:20:30	DiscipleOfDante	The thing I hate
2014-04-21 15:20:35	DiscipleOfDante	Is that it uses GTK 3
2014-04-21 15:20:43	DiscipleOfDante	And that it is Mint-centric
2014-04-21 15:20:58	DiscipleOfDante	And that it doesn't have native support for panels on the sides, I have to use Cinnadock for that
2014-04-21 15:21:08	DiscipleOfDante	And Cinnadock doesn't have a "span whole screen" option
2014-04-21 15:22:21	DiscipleOfDante	Also it has no menubar applet

2014-06-12 12:13:54	Inkane	this should show multiple bars
2014-06-12 12:13:59	hid	indeed
2014-06-12 12:14:10	Inkane	what are the values for master and speaker?
2014-06-12 12:14:42	Inkane	Tylik: Maybe you could  ask in our forum? Maybe someone there is more familiar with your hardware
2014-06-12 12:14:48	hid	\o/
2014-06-12 12:15:03	hid	Inkane: the pc speakers work
2014-06-12 12:15:08	Inkane	great
2014-06-12 12:15:32	hid	So basically i just have to do the same thing for my headphones?
2014-06-12 12:15:38	Inkane	yep
2014-06-12 12:15:56	Inkane	if the settings are lost after a reboot
2014-06-12 12:16:00	Inkane	you should check the forum
2014-06-12 12:16:10	Inkane	I think there's an old thread about how to solve this
2014-06-12 12:16:25	hid	and how to change?
2014-06-12 12:16:28	hid	i mean
2014-06-12 12:16:57	Inkane	hid: use the up/down arrow keys to modify the value
2014-06-12 12:16:59	hid	after selecting the hedphones option, the sound still is from the pc speakers

2014-06-12 12:17:28	Inkane	hid: and you have your headphones plugged in?
2014-06-12 12:18:10	hid	Inkane: yes
2014-06-12 12:18:16	Inkane	in that case, set the speaker value to 0, and the headphone one to the desired value
2014-06-12 12:18:34	Inkane	pulseaudio should handle the switch when you disconnect the headphones
