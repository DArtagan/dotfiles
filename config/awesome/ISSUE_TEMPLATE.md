# If you have an issue

**Please read the wiki and browse the Issues section first.**

If you can't find a solution there, then go ahead and provide:

* output of `awesome -v` and `lua -v`
* expected behavior and actual behavior
* steps to reproduce the problem


# If you have a new feature or theme request

Write a detailed description of the desired design, preferably with screenshots or mockups.
